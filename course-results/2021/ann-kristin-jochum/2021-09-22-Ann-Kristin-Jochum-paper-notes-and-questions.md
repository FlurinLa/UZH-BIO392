## *Finding the Rare Pathogenic Variants in a Human Genome* by Evans et al.

### Notes
* Decreases in cost of DNA sequencing lead to calls for routine genome-scale sequencing for healthy individuals to discover clinically important information
* An individual's genome contains millions of sites where his or her DNA differs from reference sequence (defined by international Genome Reference Consortium)
* Clinical interpretation relies on control and population data sets, review of medical literature and patient's phenotype
* Limitation when interpreting genomic findings in healthy individuals, since risk estimates where derived from studying patients presenting clinically, thus selecting for the most extreme cases
* Biggest problem of genome sequencing of healthy individuals is unnecessary medical intervention due to fals-positive findings or overdiagnoses
* To prevent this, gene-specific thresholds and a broad knowledge base from sequencing many healthy individuals is necessary
* 1 to 2% of US population harbors genetic variant in well-studied genes with the potential to benefit from established preventive modalities if the elevated risk were known
* Costs for WGS are falling, but substantial medical costs are generated also from the interpretation and the downstream actions
* At the moment, evidence doesn't support WGS in healthy individuals
