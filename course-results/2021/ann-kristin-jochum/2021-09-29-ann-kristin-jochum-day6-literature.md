# Literature notes of day 6

## *BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features* by Quinlan and Hall

### Notes
* Determining whether genomic features overlap or are associated with one another is fundamental for genomics research
* Mostly in Browser Extensible Data (BED) or General Feature Format (GFF)
* Until then: UCSC Genome Browser's "Table Browser" or Galaxy interface were used
  => not appropriate for large and/r *ad hoc* datasets
* Need for faster and more flexible tools
* 

## How we count

### Notes
* Counting systems used by the UCSC Genome Browser
  * “1-start, fully-closed” = coordinates positioned within the web-based UCSC Genome Browser
  * “0-start, half-open” = coordinates stored in database tables
