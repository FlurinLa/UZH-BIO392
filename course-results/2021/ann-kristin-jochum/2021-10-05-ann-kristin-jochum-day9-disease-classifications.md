# Disease classifications

## ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases 10)

### Use
* System to classify diseases with an emphasis on clinical practicability
* Established by the WHO
* Code with 1 letter and 4 digits, first 3 for a general diagnosis, the rest for more precision
* ICD-11 was published in may 2019
* Mostly used by clinicians for coding of diagnoses and billing purposes

### Advantages
* Disease entities can be compared between different countries, e.g. in studies

### Disadvantages
* Personally, I think it's not that intuitive

## ICD-O-3 (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology 3)

### Use
* Extension of the ICD for oncology
* Mostly used by pathologists
* Also established by the WHO
* Consists of two codes, one for the topography and for the morphology of the neoplasm
* **Topography**: site of the neoplasm, same as code in ICD
* **Morphology**: describes cell type and biology

### Advantages
* More precise than just using the ICD

### Disadvantages
* No ontology and not hierarchical 
* Difficult to map to other systems because of the two-part code

## NCIt (National Cancer Institute thesaurus)

### Use
* Annotates specific code to site-specific diagnoses (including morphology)
* A standard for biomedical coding and reference
* Hierarchical organisation
* One entry can show up in different branches

### Advantages
* More logical organisation
* I would guess it's more easy to use for bioinformatics (due to the hierarchical organisation)
* Only one code per entity

### Disadvantages
* More codes necessary(?)
