# BLAST exercises

## Exercise 1

* **Organism**: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
* **Accession number**: OK275080.1
* **Max score**:3232
* **Query cover**: 100%
* **E value**: 0.0
* **Covered region**: 21624 to 23373
* **DNA or RNA**: RNA
* **Protein**: BLASTx => surface glycoprotein (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)

## Exercise 2

* **Most possible manually reviewed entry**: 	P01116
* **Protein**: GTPase KRas
* **Organism**: Homo sapiens
* **Function of the protein**: Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity, plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation, plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in a ZNF304-dependent manner.
* **Variant associated with acute leukemia**: Natural variant VAR_034601; G â†’ GG in AML; expression in 3T3 cell causes cellular transformation; expression in COS cells activates the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway; lower GTPase activity; faster GDP dissociation rate.
