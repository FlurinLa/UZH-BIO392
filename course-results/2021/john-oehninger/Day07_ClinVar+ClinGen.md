|Gene|Gene name|Chromosomal location|Gene product|Disease|
|----|---------|--------------------|------------|-------|
|CFTR|CF transmembrane conductance regulator|7q31.2|Epithelial ion channel, transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane.|Cystic fibrosis|
|CYBB|cytochrome b-245 beta chain|Xp21.1-p11.4|Critical component of membrane bound oxidase of phagocytes that generates superoxide.|Granulomatous disease, chrinic, X-linked|
|HJV|hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor|1q21.1|Acts as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor.|Hemochromatosis type 2A|
|CDKN2A|cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A|9p21.3|Acts a s a negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by interacting strongly with CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibits their ability to interact with cyclins D and to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein.|Melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome|
|KRAS|KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase|12p12.1|Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity.|Noonan syndrome|
|TP53|tumor protein p53|17p13.1|Acts as a tumor supressor in many tumor types.|Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1 & familial ovarian cancer|
|FMR1|FMRP translational regulator 1|Xq27.3|Multifunctional polyribosome-associated RNA-binding protein that plays a central role in neural development and synaptic plasticity through the regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA dendritic transport and postsynaptic local protein synthesis of a subset of mRNAs.|Fragile X syndrome|
