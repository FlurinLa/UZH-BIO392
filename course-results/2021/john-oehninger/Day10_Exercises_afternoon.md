## Introduction to Genome Versions

The first human genome was finished in 2003 as a result of the human genome project, which was conducted using sanger sequencing on multiple individuals.
The reference genomes are maintained by the **Genome Reference Consortium**.


### Versions of reference genomes for various species
The name and time of the latest version for Human, Mouse and E Coli:
> * Human: GRCh38/hg38 - December 2013
> * Mouse: GRCm39/mm39 - June 2020
> * E Coli: K-12 MG1655 - 1997

The name and time of the first version for Human, Mouse and E Coli:
> * Human: hg1 - May 2000
> * Mouse: MGSCv2/mm1 - November 2001
> * E Coli: K-12 MG1655 - 1997

How many reference genomes were released in total for Human, Mouse and E Coli:
> * Human: 18
> * Mouse: 11
> * E Coli: 1


## Introduction to the UCSC Genome Browser

The USCS Genome Browser is hosted by the University of California in Santa Cruz.
It is a graphical visualization tool of genomic data.
It provides a broad collection of species and annotation, along with a large suite of tools.
Though this is not the only website/tool for genome browsing, it is perhaps the most widespread in the community.

### USCS questions

Show gene TP53 in the genome broser.
> * *NA*

Where is this gene?
> * chr17:7,668,421-7,687,490

How many isoforms does it have?
> * 9

How many exons does it have?
> * 11

What's the size of its longest exon?
> * *NA*

Find the three closest genes in upstream and downstream, respectively
> * ATP1B2, WRAP53 & EFNB3

Switch to hg19 and find TP53
> * *NA*

What are the start and end positions
> * chr17:7,571,720-7,590,868

Switch to zebrafish, can you find TP53
> * Yes

Switch to Fruitfly, can you find TP53? 
> * No
