# First of all, what are copy number variations?
A copy number variation (CNV) is when the number of copies of a particular gene varies from one individual to the next. Following the completion of the Human Genome Project, it became apparent that the genome experiences gains and losses of genetic material. The extent to which copy number variation contributes to human disease is not yet known. It has long been recognized that some cancers are associated with elevated copy numbers of particular genes.

## Why do we need a CNV map on healthy individuals of various ethnicities?
CNV maps of healthy people from all ethnicities are needed so geneticists can discriminate pathogenic or high-risk variants from benign variants in patients.



## CNV sizes
The current map includes microscopic and submicroscopic variants from 50 bp to 3 Mb.


## Methods for CNV detection
The most common approaches are with Microarrays and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).
* ### Microarrays
These are good for studying quantitative variants, but their resolution is rather limited.
Microarrays with large clones have been used in the past, but today CGH-arrays and SNP-based arrays are being used. Duplications are more likely to be missed by SNP-based arrays and NGS methods.
* ### Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
NGS can detect the very small variants with high accuracy. It is very sensitive and delivers high resolution compared to array based methods.

## Criteria for cluster filtering and its purpose
Clusters were filtered on the basis of the number of distinct subjects that carry the variant and the number of distinct studies with at least one variant in the cluster.

## Thresholds in stringency level 1, inclusive map (stringency level 2) and stringent map (stringency level 3)
* Stringency level 1: At least one subject and one study
* Stringency level 2: At least two subjects and one study
* Stringency level 3: At least two subjects and two studies

## What percentage of the genome contributes to CNV in inclusive map and stringency map respectively?
* Stringency map: 9.5% (7.5% gains, 3.9% losses)
* Inclusive map: 1.1 - 16.4% gains and 4.3 - 19.2% losses
