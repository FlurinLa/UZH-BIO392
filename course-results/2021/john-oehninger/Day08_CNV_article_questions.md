# A copy number variation map of the human genome - 03.02.2015

## Why do we need a CNV map?



## CNV sizes
They mention that the current map includes microscopic and submicroscopic variants from 50 bp to 3 Mb.


## Methods for CNV detection
### Microarrays
These are good for studying quantitative variants.
### Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
