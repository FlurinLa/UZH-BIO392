# A copy number variation map of the human genome

## Why do we need a CNV map on healthy individuals of various ethnicities?
CNV maps of healthy people from all ethnicities are needed so geneticists can discriminate pathogenic or high-risk variants from benign variants in patients.



## CNV sizes
The current map includes microscopic and submicroscopic variants from 50 bp to 3 Mb.


## Methods for CNV detection
The most common approaches are with Microarrays and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).
* ### Microarrays
These are good for studying quantitative variants, but their resolution is rather limited.
Microarrays with large clones have been used in the past, but today CGH-arrays and SNP-based arrays are being used. Duplications are more likely to be missed by SNP-based arrays and NGS methods.
* ### Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
NGS can detect the very small variants with high accuracy. It is very sensitive and delivers high resolution compared to array based methods.
