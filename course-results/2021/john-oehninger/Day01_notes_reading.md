# Notes on the Articles regarding Genome Sequence Variation

## Finding the Rare Pathogenic Variants in a Human Genome - James P. et al.
This article is short and a nice read. It sums up the essential information on the topic of implementation and use of data gathered from large scale sequencing. It's all about the hunt for rare (or not rare) pathogenic variants in humans.
Here are some key notes from the artice:
* DNA sequencing has become very cheap in comparison to when the technology was invented.
* Genomic information rarely results in a yes or no answer about disease state, but give rise in interpretation of probabilistic estimate of risk.
* Factors regarding the chane of an individual manifesting a genetic disease:
  * Certainty with which a variant is associated with disease
  * Likelihood that an individual with a pathogenic variant will develop disease <br>
 
  `--> Lack of knowledge  of either  factor impairs the predicitve value of genetic information, which results in false-positives  `

* To minimize false-positives,there need to be thresholds and necessary knowledge from sequencing many healthy individuals.
* But we can't only focus on the big image. Studying very specific regions of the genome will come to more usage and implimentation in the real world, especially if these are regions that are already understood well and are pathogenic. Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer are the best example for this. (Sidenote: The most published cancer type is breast cancer.
* The hype of advocacy towards broadly sequencing healthy individuals has a catch that comes with it. We like to justify it by it's cost. But there are other costs that result from this process. These are from the interpretation of these tests and form the downstream actions that ther results trigger.
* There is no systematic evidence that supports genome sequencing in healthy individuals.
* **Sequencing is great and cheap nowadays, but we won't pull a benefit from it by broadly performing it on entire genomes of healthy individuals. Future research should focus on targeted sequencing for screening healthy individuals.**
