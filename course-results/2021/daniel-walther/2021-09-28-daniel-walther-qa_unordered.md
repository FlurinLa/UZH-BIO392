# unordered questions about the lecture BIO392 in general, etc


Q: Discussion planned at some specific point in time?

A: Not specifically, could be interesting & fun. Maybe at the end of the course would be a good time point. \[Let's wing it as we go, depends also on the notes you upload.\]

=> So a good overview and understanding of the topic is of more direct use personally, maybe - more complete and coherent understand of the course's topics in general, connection, relation.


Q: mobile insertion elements?

A: genetic elemens (sequences) that can jump and duplicate themselves, like (retro-)transposons.
