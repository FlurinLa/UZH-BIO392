# day09 recap, survival, classification

'Survival' is not strictly clinical in meaning, but more dynamic/flexible in usage

## Task: Explor. of diff. file formats

CRAM - what is it?
A: "Basically BAM on Speed. Even more compressed. (elaboration)"

MPEG-G
"sometimes you need special access permissions" - not sure for what, either for accessing files or accessing something more downstream.

### Kaplan-Meier method

Btw: most common method of estimating survival function.

Start with overall (over whole sample size) survival prob. 1, cumulatively reduce it over the course of the study

btw: regarding publication of survival data of gene expression, e.g. - need clinical levels of control for your study for journals to publish it.

When looking at new e.g. therapies in the wild, I recommend you to look into the details of respective studies.

## Cancer classifications

"Have to know there are some types, maybe rough knowledge about differences / details."~

### Cancer classifications - WHO

2 codes per cancer - 1 code for the cancer type, 1 code for the location of the cancer (which can vary - metastasis etc.). trajectory [of diesease] can differ greatly depending on how you approach a cancer therapy" (e.g. only focus on location or also on the cancer's origin

### Cancer ('Neoplasm') classifications - NCIt (National Cancer Institute [thesaurus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thesaurus) )

1 code per cancer (type & location combined/merged into one code)

### TNM (Tumor size, lymph Nodes, Metastases)
A classificaiton for clinical cancer stage parameters

3 codes per cancer: T, N, M: T1-4, N0-3 (also NX), M0/1

## Tasks:

"For searches on progenetix.org (NCIt): please don't choose ones which have ~1k samples or more. you can, but stuff takes forever" on website / data analysis.
