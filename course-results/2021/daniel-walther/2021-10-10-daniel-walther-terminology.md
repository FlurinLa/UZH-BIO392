# terminology of the BIO392 course

This is an unordered compilation of terms I deemed worthwile to write a definition of (personally well-known terms are not included, e.g. genome). Also included are some insights that might meaningfully connect two separately treated topics from the course. Translations between german and english might also occur sometimes.


__terminology:__

_haplotypes:_ A haplotype (haploid genotype) is a group of alleles in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent. (wikipedia)

_isoforms:_

_first-generation sequencing:_ e.g. Sanger sequencing - 'dideoxy chain termination method'.

_second-generation sequencing:_ e.g. Solexa/Illumina's 'bridge amplification' and 'flowcell bound clusters' sequencing methods. Parallel sequencing of multiple reads possible. SBS method. Amplification still required.

_third-generation sequencing:_ aka next-generation sequencing (NGS). massively parallel, single-mocule, and real-time sequencing ~. e.g. PacBio's SMRT sequencing platform (single molecule real time). Also Oxford Nanopore's ... nanopore based sequencing techniques 

_variant calling:_ identifying (true/meaningful/significant) variation, usually in genomic data, e.g. identifying genomic variants of tumour cells in individual patients.

_reference genomes:_ Reference genomes describe the 'consensus' DNA sequence.

_genome variants:_

_resources of reference genomes / genome variants:_

_structural variation:_ (guess:) structural variation is difference in the structure of the gene expression product (be it miRNAs or proteins), instead of pure variation in nucleotide sequence.

_copy number variation (CNV):_ variation in the number of copies of a given genome region (exons, genes, bands, chromosomes - all levels).

_epigenetics:_ In biology, epigenetics is the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. (wikipedia)

_functional genomics:_ Functional genomics is a field of molecular biology that attempts to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions.(wikipedia). In contrast to 'traditional' genomics where the nucleotide sequence is the goal.

_contig sequence:_ 


__meta-insights:__

_variant calling & reference genomes / genome variants:_ variant calling workflows / algorithms are crucial in refining sequencing data for the usage in creation and improvement of reference genomes. More directly, variant calling is required to objectively identify genome/-ic variants to be compared to the reference genomes.
