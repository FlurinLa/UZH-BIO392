# terminology of the BIO392 course

This is an unordered compilation of terms I deemed worthwile to write a definition of (personally well-known terms are not included, e.g. genome). Also included are some insights that might meaningfully connect two separately treated topics from the course. Translations between german and english might also occur sometimes.


__terminology:__

_haplotypes:_

_isoforms:_

_first-generation sequencing:_ e.g. Sanger sequencing

_second-generation sequencing:_ e.g. 

_third-generation sequencing:_ aka next-generation sequencing (NGS). massively parallel, single-mocule, and real-time sequencing ~.

_variant calling:_ identifying (true/meaningful/significant) variation, usually in genomic data, e.g. identifying genomic variants of tumour cells in individual patients.

_reference genomes:_

_genome variants:_

_resources of reference genomes / genome variants:_

_structural variation:_ (guess:) structural variation is difference in the structure of the gene expression product (be it miRNAs or proteins), instead of pure variation in nucleotide sequence.

_copy number variation (CNV):_


__meta-insights:__

_variant calling & reference genomes / genome variants:_ variant calling workflows / algorithms are crucial in refining sequencing data for the usage in creation and improvement of reference genomes. More directly, variant calling is required to objectively identify genome/-ic variants to be compared to the reference genomes.
