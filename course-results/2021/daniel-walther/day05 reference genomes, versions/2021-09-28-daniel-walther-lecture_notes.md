As of yet, I am undecided where to carry on notes about (human) reference genomes.

What I am sure of, though, is that the problem and difficulty in creating, maintaining and updating reference genomes is not a trivial one, essential for genetics research, and could potentially be used maliciously with great impact on other research groups' / entities' proggress (e.g. the minimalistic cooperation (to be generous) of China in investigating the origin of SARS-CoV-2, to be controversial).
Thus this topic requires some attention & effort if one is interested in genetics and related fields.

# day 05 lecture notes

Generally, this short lecture was about _human_ reference genomes and stuff surrounding this topic / field of work/research.

## versions:

There are 2 big standards, if you will: One from UCSC, another from [NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) (rather large portal for scientific articles around biotech., by the US [NIH (National Istitute of Health)](https://www.nih.gov/).

## genome liftover:

task: read up on liftover techniques - "start with our paper" - kk
"paper from us: see the papers list, switch link, ~'segment liftover' or so"~.
"also, there might some more information on the course github repo, there's a PhD student that just finished and did a lot on this topic."
