# Exercise NCIT:
* This sequence belongs to SARS-CoV-2.
* Accesion number: OK091601.1. Max score: 6929. Query cover: 100%. E value: 0.0.
* The sequence covers the region from 21595 to 25346.
* It was originally an RNA sequence but for the .... it was transformed to DNA since RNA is very unstable.
* It encodes part of a surface glycoprotein.

# Exercise Uniprot:
* Uniprot ID: P01116.	
* The sequence comes from a GTPase KRas.
* This sequence belongs to Homo sapiens (Human).
* Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity. Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation. Plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in a ZNF304-dependent manner.
* Variant associated with acute leukemia in this protein: Natural variantiVAR_034601.
