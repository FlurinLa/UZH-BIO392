# Exercise NCIT:
* This sequence belongs to SARS-CoV-2.
* Accesion number: OK091601.1. Max score: 6929. Query cover: 100%. E value: 0.0.
* The sequence covers the region from 21595 to 25346.
* It was originally an RNA sequence but for the .... it was transformed to DNA since RNA is very unstable.
* It encodes part of a surface glycoprotein.

# Exercise Uniprot:
* Uniprot ID: P0DTC2.
* The sequence comes from a Spike glycoprotein.
* This sequence belongs to SARS-CoV-2.
* Attaches the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with host receptor, initiating the infection. Binding to human ACE2 receptor and internalization of the virus into the endosomes of the host cell induces conformational changes in the Spike glycoprotein.
