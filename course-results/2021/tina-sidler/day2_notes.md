## Notes Day 2

The following notes are to the website: https://internationalgenome.org

The IGSR contains the data set produced by the 1000 Genomes Project and proceeds to include new data that follor the IGSR sampling principles. The Goals of the IGSR are to:
* **1.** Ensure the future acces to and usability of the 1000 Genomes reference data.
  * This means keeping the data up to date with current reference data sets. ISGR realigned their sequence data to GRCh38. GRCh38 was an update of the human genome reference assembly released by the Genome Reference Consortium in 2014. GRCh38 contains 178 genomic regions with associated alternative loci. The update to GRCh38 therefor increased the quantity of alternative loci represented.
* **2.** Incorporate additional published genomic data on the 1000 Genomes samples.
  * Different researchers have used the cell lines generated by the 1000 Genomes Project for their research, for example the high-coverage genomic sequence data from NYGC or the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC).
* **3.** Expand the data collection to include new populations not represented in the 1000 Genomes Project.
  *  Since the 1000 Genomes Project does not capture all populations, further samples that follow the IGSR's sample collection principles are added, for example
