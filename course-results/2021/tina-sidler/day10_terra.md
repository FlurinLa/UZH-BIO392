## Workflow

1. Set the notebook up, get the files,start IGV, etc.
2. Call somatic SNV & indels with Mutect2
* Get somatic short mutations on the HCC1143 tumor sample and matched normal -> The matched normal excludes rare germline variation that is not captured by the germline resource and individual-specific artifacts.



Questions:
1. What is the value of using a matched normal control?
* The matched normal excludes rare germline variation that is not captured by the germline resource and individual-specific artifacts.
