# Notes to 'A copy number variation map of the human genome'

## Why is important to construct a CNV map on health individuals of various ethnicities?
CNV map of healthy individuals are needes so that geneticists can discriminate pathogenic or high-risk variants from benign variants in patients.

## What is the CNV size that the authors defined?
The current map includes microscopic and submicroscopic variants from 50 bp to 3 Mb.

## What are the primary approaches used for CNV detection? And what are the advantages and limitations for these technologies?
The two primary approaches used for CNV detection are:
* **microarrays**: Good for studying quantitative variants. Have a limited resolution
* **next-generation sequencing (NGS)**: Call smaller variants and are biased towards the detection of deletions. They have both hight sensitivity and the ablity to provide accurate sequence level breakpoint resolution, 
Both approaches are not as good in detecting deletions compared to earlier platforms.
