|Gene|Gene name|Chromosomal location|Gene product|Disease|
|----|---------|--------------------|------------|-------|
|CFTR|CF transmembrane conductance regulator|7q31.2|epithelial ion channel, transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane|Cystic fibrosis|
|CYBB|cytochrome b-245 beta chain|Xp21.1-p11.4|Critical component of the membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes that generates superoxide. It is the terminal component of a respiratory chain that transfers single electrons from cytoplasmic NADPH across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen on the exterior. Also functions as a voltage-gated proton channel that mediates the H(+) currents of resting phagocytes. It participates in the regulation of cellular pH and is blocked by zinc.|granulomatous disease|
|HJV|hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor|1q21.1|Acts as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor. Through enhancement of BMP signaling regulates hepcidin (HAMP) expression and regulates iron homeostasis.|hemochromatosis type 2A|
|CDKN2A|cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A|9p21.3|Acts as a negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by interacting strongly with CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibits their ability to interact with cyclins D and to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein.|melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome|
|KRAS|KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase|12p12.1|Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (PubMed:20949621). Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:23698361, PubMed:22711838). Plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in a ZNF304-dependent manner.|Noonan syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Costello syndrome|
|TP53|tumor protein p53|17p13.1|Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type. Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 ex.|	Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1, familial ovarian cancer|
|FMR1|FMRP translational regulator 1|Xq27.3|Multifunctional polyribosome-associated RNA-binding protein that plays a central role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity through the regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA dendritic transport and postsynaptic local protein synthesis of a subset of mRNAs. Plays a role in the alternative splicing of its own mRNA. Plays a role in mRNA nuclear export.|Fragile X syndrome|
