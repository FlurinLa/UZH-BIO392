# Tasks:
### Different Concepts behind different disease classification systems - advantages, problems?
#### ICD-O
WHO international Classification of Disease for oncology. This concept is based on topography and morphology/histology of neoplasms (obtained from pathology)
It uses two codes:
* What cell type/abnormality
* Where
There is no hierarchy, so its use is, though widely accepted, limited.

#### NCIt
Neoplasm Classifications in the NCI Thesaurus. There are now individual codes for site-specific occurances of "biological" diagnoses. So there is just one code per cancer
There is a true hierarchy present which empowers logical OR queries. It thus allows groupings into soft aggregation like a type of colorectal adenocarcinoma with all colon tumors.)


#### TNM
A classification ofr clinical cancer stage parameters. **T**umor size, lymph **N**odes, **M**etastases. They might coexist with other disease soecific staging systems.

So a T3N2M0 would be:
a tumor near the airways, or spreading near a chest wall, Spreaded to a further lymph nodes without metastases in other organs.

T1N0M0:
A small tumour (< 3 cm) in size, no lymph nodes affected, no metastases
and so on
