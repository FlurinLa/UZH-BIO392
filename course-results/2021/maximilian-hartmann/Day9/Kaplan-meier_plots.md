# Kaplan-Meier-Analysis
An effeictve way to estimate the survival function is by using Kaplan-Meier CurvE (KM). In the KM analysis, three variables are important:
1. Serial time of subject
2. Their status at the end of their serial time (evenet occurence or censored)
3. The group of study they belong to


##### Censored Data
It simply means, that the information about a subject's survival time is incomplete. Most survival analysis have that problem. This can happen when ...
* A person does not experience the event before the study ends
* A person is lost to follow up during the study period
* A person withdraws from the study because of some reason
