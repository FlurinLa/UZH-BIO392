More and more attention have been brought to the costs of genome sequencing. Determining the costs for sequencing is not easy, since there are many parameters.
Different researchers and institutions track and account for such costs differently.

### Primer on Genome Sequencing
The genome is considered to e the total number of bases in one representive copy of its nuclear DNA. That corresponds to one copy of each chromosome pair in diploid organisms.
Different organisms have a different genome size, e.g:
Organism | Genome Size
---------|------------
*E. coli* | ~5 M bases
fruit fly | 123 M bases
human | 3 B bases
loblolly pine tree | 23 B bases

Obviously, the costs of genome sequencing depends on its size. Also, the representative genome of a human is 3 B bases, but the actual genome is 6 B bases in size (diploid)
Genomes cannot be sequence end-to-end in one step. First, it needs to be broken down and then sequenced resulting in a **sequence read**. The collection of sequence reads is
then computationally assambled back together.

An alternative to whole-genome sequencing is targeting sequencin, mostly protein-coding region of the genome (exome). That corresponds to ~1.5% of the total genome.
But since whole exome sequencing requires additional alboratory work, the cost of whole-exom Sequencing is not 1.5% of the whole-genome-sequencing. But for now, since fewer bases
are sequenced, it's still cheaper.

Costs also largely depends on the data quality, which itself depends on the average number each base is actually read. During the human genome project (HGP) the 
typical levels of quality considered were:
  1. "Draft Sequence": ~ 99% of the genome with ~99.9% accuracy
  2. "Finished Sequence": >95% of the genome with ~99.99% accuracy

Producing truely "Finished Sequence" is very expensive. In fact, most of the human genome sequence are "Draft Sequences".

### Timeline of Cost

The human genome project created a human reference genom with an estimated error rate of <1 in 100'000 bases of a 3 B bases genome. This is a much higher error rate than 
a typical human genome sequencing produced today.

At that time, mapping was needed as a scaffold to connect individual segments of assembled DNA sequence. That itself costs tens of millions of dollars, probably up to
hundreds of millions of dollars.
Once the human sequencing began for the HGP, a "draft" human genome sequence was produced over a time of 15 months which costs about $300 million.
The HGP then refined the draft, the cost of which is ~$150 million worldwide.

It is difficult to give a final number of cost. It lays between $500 million to $1 billion. Note, that this is only the first human genome sequence.
This should not be confused with the total cost of the HGP which lays at $2.7 billion, which is $0.3 billion less than anticpiated. This number, however, only represent the
funding from the United States.

### How much does it costs to sequence a human genome 2006
The efforts shifted to generate individual human genomes (6 B bases). The basic methodologies were refined, too. Based on the data collected by NHGRI, to cost to generate
a high-quality "draft" human genome sequence had dropped to ~$14 million in 2006. it would likely have costed up to $20-25 miollion to generate the finished human genome.
Still expensive but not that bad compared to the HGP

### How much does it cost today (2016)
New advanced have fundamentally revolutionalised DNA sequencing (==> next generation sequencing).
In 2015, the most common approach for sequencing and individual's human genomes involves generating a "draft" sequence and comparing it to a reference human genome, so as to
catalog all sequence variants. Such a routine does not require any sequence finishing. that sequence is typically targeted to all exons or aimed at the entire ~6 B bases.
The quality is based on the amount of average base redundancy provided by the generated data. (Higher redundancy costing more)

Direct cost comparisment between commercial and academic genome-sequencing is hard. There are differences in what each includes in the cost, with such details often not
revealed by privat companies. Also, distinction between price and costs must be applied.

Based on the Data of the NHGRI, the cost to generate a high-quality draft in mid-2015 was just above $4'000, by late 2015 it had fallen below $1'500. The cost of a
whole-exon sequence was generally below $1'000. Commercial prices for whole-genome and whole-exome sequences have often, but not always, been slightly below these numbers

## [The international genome sample resource (IGSR)](https://www.internationalgenome.org/)
The 1000 Genomes Project created a catalogue of common human genetic variation from people that declared themself to be healthy.. This reference data resource
is heavily used by the biomedical science community.

The IGSR ensures the future usability and accessibility of data from the 1000 genome project and to extend the data set produced by the 1000 Genomes Project to include new
data generated from the 1000 Genomes Project samples and new population where sampling has been carried out in line with the new sampling principles.
