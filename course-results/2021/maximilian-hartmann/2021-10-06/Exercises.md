## Exercises
>Most species have more than one versions of the reference genome. Please find out:
>1. The name and time of the latest version for Human, Mouse and E Coli. 
>2. The name and time of the first version for Human, Mouse and E Coli. 
>3. How many reference genomes were released in total for Human, Mouse, 
>and E Coli.

1. 
|Species|time|genome name|
|-------|----|-----------|
|Human|01.03.2019|GRCh38p13|
|Mouse|24.06.2020 |GRCm39 |
|_E. coli_| 26.09.2013| ASM584v2|

2.
|Species|time|genome name|
|-------|----|-----------|
|Human|May 2000 | hg1|
|Mouse|November 2001|mm1|
|_E. coli_|2013| ASM584v2|

3.
Human: 18    
Mouse: 11    
_E. coli_: 2    

> What do you think of the difference between genome versions?
> 1. Find out the difference in chromosome length between the latest patch of 
> hg38 and the last patch of hg19. The name and time of the first version for 
> Human, Mouse and E Coli. 
> 2. With your favorite gene, find out its position in hg38 and hg18.
