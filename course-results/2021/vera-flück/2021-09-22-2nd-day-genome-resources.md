# Resource notes

## Day 2

### First Task
*Browse/explore genome resources and provide some notes (1-2 pages total) in a doc posted on Github (.md):*

[NIH Genome sequencing costs page](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Sequencing-Human-Genome-cost)<

#### Genome Sequencing Cost

With the growing scale of human genetics studies and the increasing number of clinical applications for genome sequencing, even greater attention is being paid to understanding the underlying costs of generating a human genome sequence. The NHGRI has carefully tracked costs per genome for many years (see Figure 1).

## Genome
Earlier this year, the New York Genome Center (NYGC) released high-coverage (30x) data for an additional 698 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project sample collections. These 698 samples are related to the original set of 2,504 samples previously sequenced by NYGC. The 2,504 samples are a set of samples unrelated to each other that made up the panel used by the 1000 Genomes Project in its third (and final) phase. This brings the total number of samples sequenced to high-coverage by NYGC to 3,202, in work funded by NHGRI.

### Second Task

* read up on yesterdayâ€™s general genome variation papers
* make notes
* think about questions for discussion rounds

#### The sequence of sequencers: The history of sequencing
* First-generation DNA sequencing
* Second-generation DNA sequencing
* Third-generation DNA sequencing

#### Finding the Rare Pathogenic Variants in a Human Genome


#Changing something here to see the change in Github.

Note:

>For example, current estimates of genetic risks in a healthy individual carrying a disease-associated variant discovered by sequencing are likely inflated since risk estimates have been derived from studying patients presenting clinically, thus selecting for the most extreme cases.
