# Genome Versions

## Exercises 1
Most species have more than one versions of the reference genome. 
Please find out:

**1. The name and time of the latest version for Human, Mouse and E Coli**
* Human: December 2013 GRCh38/hg38
* Mouse: June 2020 GRChm39/mm39
* E Coli: September 2013 MG1655


**2. The name and time of the first version for Human, Mouse and E Coli**
* Human: July 2003 NCBI34/hg16
* Mouse: August 2005 NCBI35/mm7
* E Coli: only one version September 2013 MG1655


**3. How many reference genomes were released in total for Human, Mouse, and E Coli**
H: 5, M: 5, E: 1 = 11

## Challenges
* For human genomic data generated before 2013 , it was for sure based on an older version. 
* Most data generated a few years ago were still using the old assembly. 
* It creates a big pitfall when using genomic data 

**Can you imagine some troubles it may bring to your study or research?**
It could be, that you have been working with not the latest data

## Exercises 2
What do you think of the diference between genome versions?

1. Find out the difference in chromosome length between the latest patch of 
hg38 and the last patch of hg19.
GRCh38/hg38: Chr1: 248,956,422 bp
GRCh37/hg19: Chr1: 249,250,621 bp


2. With your favorite gene, find out its position in hg38 and hg18.
hg38: IL2; chr4:122,451,470-122,456,725; lenght 5,256 bp.
hg18: IL2; chr4:123,592,076-123,597,100; lenght 5,025 bp.

2. Where is this gene? (chromosome, cytoband, and exact start and end positions)
Chromosome 17, Cytoband: p13.1
Start position: 7,668,421
End position: 7,687,490
Lenght: 19,070 bp

3. How many isoforms does it have?

17 isoforms

4. How many exons does it have? 

11 exons

5. What the size of its longest exon? (roughly) 

1200 bp

6. Find the three closest genes in upstream and downstream, respectively. 
Downstream:
Human Gene ATP1B2 (ENST00000250111.9)
Human Gene SHBG (ENST00000570547.5)
Human Gene SAT2 (ENST00000269298.10)

Upstream:
Human Gene WRAP53 (ENST00000316024.9)
Human Gene EFNB3 (ENST00000226091.3)
Human Gene DNAH2 (ENST00000572933.5)

## Exercise 2

1. Switch to hg19 and find TP53. 
2. What is the start and end positions?

Start position: 7,571,720
End position: 7,590,868
Lenght: 19,149 bp.

3. Switch to zebrafish, can you find TP53?

4. Switch to Fruitfly, can you find TP53?
No

# Genome Liftover

## Exercise 1
Liftover with UCSC Genome Browser

1. Down-lift: TP53 from hg38 to hg19
Extract BED file using Browser Table.

2. Up-lift: TP53 from hg19 to hg38 
The file I received from point 1 above was conversed again from hg19 to hg38. Liftover worked.

3. Cross-species-lift: TP53 from human to mouse 
Liftover worked

4. Multi-step-lift: TP53 from hg38 to hg 18
Liftover worked

## Exercise 2
Liftover with UCSC Genome Browser

1. Liftover multiple positions with a BED file.
2. Lift a larger range and interpret the result.

Some regions cannot be conversed.

3. Limitations of the liftover:
If a position exists in one and not in the other assembly, it cannot be liftOver.
Meaning, if a regions has been deleted or added.
If positions are too long, they may be seperated and cannot e mapped properly to another assembly.
state-of-the-art remapping tools only consider the degree of
similarity between a read and the constant regions (from the chain file) in the old
reference, without considering the changes in the new reference when remapping
the read to the new reference. This can result in a poor degree of similarity between the read and the new reference.
