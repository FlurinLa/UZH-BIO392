# A global reference for human genetic variation

## Introduction
Made to provide a comprehensive description of common human genetic variation by applying whole-genome sequencing to many individuals.
All individuals were sequenced using both whole-genome sequencing (mean depth = 7.4X) and targeted exome sequencing (mean depth = 65.7X)
