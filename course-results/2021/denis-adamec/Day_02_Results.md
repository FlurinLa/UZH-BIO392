* [Cancer Genome Interpreter](https://www.cancergenomeinterpreter.org/home)

The Cancer Genome interpreter is a tool used primarily for the identification of oncogenic alterations in a known cancer genome.
In order to identify an alteration (point mutation, block substitution, indel, complex indel, etc.) specific input formats have to be used.
Additionally, the match can be attempted to a specific cancer type or a generic cancer type should the specific type be unknown. 
Two reference genomes (hg37 and hg19) can be used.

Upon succesful identification of an oncogenic alteration, potentially effective prescriptions are directly displayed:
