*** Bioinformatic tools & Programs

* Versions always need to be tracked
* Use Package and download managers to make sure everything is correct & reproducible

* Makefile: Translates source code to executables
* Increases performance and optimises software execution for the host OS

*** Transposable Elements

* Lots of repeated DNA Sequences can be found in our DNA (Tandem Repeats, Transposons, etc.)
* Can be classified into: By Nature (DNA Transpsons or Retrotransposons)

|Gene|Gene name|Chromosomal location|Gene product|Disease|
|----|---------|--------------------|------------|-------|
|CFTR|CF transmembrane conductance regulator|7q31.2|Ion channel located in the Epithelium which transports chloride ions across the cell membrane.|Cystic fibrosis|
|CYBB|cytochrome b-245 beta chain|Xp21.1-p11.4|Essential component of membrane bound oxidase of various phagocytes that generates superoxide.|Granulomatous disease, chrinic, X-linked|
|HJV|hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor|1q21.1|Coreceptor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) .|Hemochromatosis type 2A|
|CDKN2A|cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A|9p21.3|Interacts strongly with CDK4 and CDK6 and therefore acts as a negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells. The ability to interact with cyclins D and to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein is inhibited.|Melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome|
|KRAS|KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase|12p12.1|Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity.|Noonan syndrome|
|TP53|tumor protein p53|17p13.1|Widespread tumor suppressor.|Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1 & familial ovarian cancer|
|FMR1|FMRP translational regulator 1|Xq27.3|Multifunctional polyribosome-associated RNA-binding protein. Plays a central role in neural development and synaptic plasticity through the regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA dendritic transport and postsynaptic local protein synthesis of a subset of mRNAs.|Fragile X syndrome|
