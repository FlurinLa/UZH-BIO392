## Progenetix & GA4GH

Cancer genomics resource built around and driving GA4GH standards

* Genomic Imbalances in Cancers (CNV)
	* Point Mutations
	* Chromosomal Rearrangements
	* Epigenetic changer (e.g. DNA Methylation abnormalities
	* Regional Copy Number Alterations
	* ~20% of the entire Genome is out of balance in Cancer (on avg. across cancer types)

### Progenetix

* largest open resource for curated cancer genome profiling data (focus on CNVs)
* >116'000 cancer CNV profiles, mapped to 800 NCIT Codes


## Genomic Data & Privacy

* ~5 Million variants per human genome, most are "rare", even fewer are actual driver mutations
* Limited Population Diversity in Cancer studies 
* Data from Genomics trial in Germany cannot be "transported" to US - Leal Barriers etc.
* A federated data ecosystem seeks to share genomic data globally without requiring compatible data sets or compromising patient identity
* Beacons were implemented as a measure to anonymize genomic disease data, but still pose certain security risks, such as the ability to identifiy if individuals are present in disease databases if their genome is known
