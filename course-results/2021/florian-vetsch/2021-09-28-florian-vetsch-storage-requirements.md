## 1000 haploid human genomes' storage cost:  
500k CHF per 1PB for data storage in general  
WGS 3*10^9 bp  
WES 3*10^7 bp   
50CHF/genome(30x BAM format)  
[SAM to BAM storage savings:](https://uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/using-cram-to-compress-bam-files/) approx. 75%  
[Human WGS(30x) in VCF format](https://www.biostars.org/p/47646/): approx: 95 GB
[2*10^8 bp saved in FASTA:](https://biowize.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/can-i-estimate-genome-size-from-the-size-of-the-fasta-file/) approx 200MB  
WGS would then be approx 50 CHF per year as well, which is very odd as **FASTA** would be by large margin the biggest ressource to store and therefore the **most expensive**

### Cost in CHF per 1 genome(30x)/exome(90x) per year
|  | WES| WGS|
|--------|--------|-----------|
| FASTA | 3% of WGS | no reliable source* |
| SAM | 6 | 200 |
| BAM | 1.50 | 50 |
| VCF | 1.50 | 50 |  

*but certainly most expensive  
  
Of course this are all very unprecise approximations that are only meant to give a relation for the prices!
