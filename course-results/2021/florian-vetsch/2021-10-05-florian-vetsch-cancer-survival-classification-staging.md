## Cancer classification systems:
* ICD-10:
  * often used in clinicals
  * (-) only site information; no specific morphology
* ICD-O-3:
  * widely accepted by pathologists
  * (+) clear info on site and morphology by using two codes
  * (-) not really used in clinics; no ontology & not (truly) hierarchical
* NCIT:
  *  1 code per cancer
  *  (+) truly hierarchical; preferred terms, synonyms, research codes, external source codes are searchable


## Cancer stage

Notes:   
T3,T4 are about location of tumor not size anymore;  
<s> N1,N2,N3 are implying M1 </s>  
> N3 basically says "heavy/distant lymph node infiltration"; but as long as no other organs are involved or the cancer cells have broken the node capsule it isn't considered "metastasized".
... oddly, people may use "metastasized to lymph nodes" and "lymph node metastasis"; but these are kept as separate concepts.
