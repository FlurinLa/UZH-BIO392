## <<how big is a genome in terms of bytes?

So, I found a good article which gives a good overview about how to calculate the ways, in which different sizes of basepairs can be converted into Bytes. 

Below I will present a table, where one can check which file takes how many Bytes for which size of base pairs. 


[The article can be found here](https://medium.com/precision-medicine/how-big-is-the-human-genome-e90caa3409b0). 


| File format   | Base pairs    | Bytes  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| None, just bp | whole genome  | 700mb |
| FASTQ         | whole genome  | 200mb |
| VCF           | whole genome  | 125mb |


So now I will present the calculations:
