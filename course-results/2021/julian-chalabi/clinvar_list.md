CYBB             | cytochrome b-245 beta chain| Xp21.1-p11.4                |  Critical component of the membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes that generates superoxide.  | granulomatous disease, chronic, X-linked
HJV              |     hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor         | 1q21.1|Acts as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor. | hemochromatosis type 2A
CDKN2A           |     cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A          |     9p21.3  | Acts as a negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by interacting strongly with CDK4 and CDK6. | melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome 
Kras             |    KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase       |     12p12.1  |Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (PubMed:20949621). Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:23698361, PubMed:22711838). Plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in a ZNF304-dependent manner (PubMed:24623306). | Noonan syndrome,  cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome,  Costello syndrome 
TP53             |    tumor protein p53         |    17p13.1|Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type. Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 ex|  Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1,  familial ovarian cancer
