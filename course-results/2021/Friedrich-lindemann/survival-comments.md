### Format
* very versatile to represent population impacts of genome variations
* cumulative or overlapping would be also great to show if more samples of it were present
* since they arent likely based on individual examination
* large filesize submitted by large variety of bodies creates room for inconsistent data
* important to learn more about exeption cases and programming to avoid them
* object types and data sheet format can present issues

### takeaway
* using R would be easier imo
* need seperate csv editor
* exeption handling knowledge expand
* maybe visit a psychiatrist
