### 1. Clinical genome sequenzing

* What parts of genome sequencing processes are the bottlenecks in reducing costs further?
* The line between moral an amoral when deciding with what birth defects a child is allowed to be born before it goes against preventing suffering in its own interest?
* Does your genetic code fall under personal information, if it creates a disposition towards lets say smoking addiction are companies allowed to market that to you under that basis?

### 2. Genomic sequencing history
* Has there been attempts to creat living animals with drasitically removed non coding sections?
### 3. 1000 genomes project
* What copy number was chosen for non coding segments when they vary wildly within the population? (solved in class)
* Do we know what the bottlenecks refer to in our history?
### 4. Eichler
* Have there been GWAS studies attempting to associate CNV with certain alleles?
### 5. costs of sequencing
* promising research into lowering costs?
