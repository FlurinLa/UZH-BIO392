### Reference Genome Resources
* genome.ucsc.edu UCSC genome browser
  * open source
  * human and closely related species, as well as mice
  * has its own alignment tool (BLAT), PCR design and genome annotation tools
  * multi level comparison, gene control/expression, SNPs, locus and mutations, conservation
  * full sequenced sars cov genome
  * originated from the human genome project
  * widely used and referenced
* HUMAN GENOME RESOURCES AT NCBI
  * international dna data bank

  * only human genome
  * vast array of searching and sorting tools (BLAST etc.)
  * contains dbVar, clinVar, dbSNP as subsection for respective content
  * virtual library with literature and reference material
  * difficult to navigate due to size

### Cancer Variant resources
* arrayMap/Progenetix'
  * meta analysis og human cancers
  * smaller size doue to lack of beins to jit
### other
