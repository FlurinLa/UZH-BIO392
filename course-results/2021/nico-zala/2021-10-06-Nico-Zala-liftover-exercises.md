> What do you think of the difference between genome versions?

- Find out the difference in chromosome length between the latest patch of
hg38 and the last patch of hg19. 

  - hg38 total sequence length: 3,099,706,404  
  - hg19 total sequence length: 3,101,788,170  
  - difference in chromosome length btw hg38 and hg19: 2'081'766 bp  

- With your favorite gene, find out its position in hg38 and hg18.

  - hg38: OCA2 at chr15:27754875-28099315  
  - hg17: OCA2 at chr15:25673616-26018056
