  - Mouse: GRCm39/mm39 (Jun 2020)
  - E. Coli: ASM584v2 (Sep 2013)
  
* The name and time of the first version for Human, Mouse and E Coli.
  - Human: NCBI34/hg16 (July 2003)
  - Mouse: NCBI35/mm7 (Aug 2005)
  - E. Coli: ASM584v1 (Jun 2004)


* How many reference genomes were released in total for Human, Mouse, and E Coli.
  - Human: 5
  - Mouse: 5

> What do you think of the difference between genome versions?

- Find out the difference in chromosome length between the latest patch of
hg38 and the last patch of hg19. 

  - hg38 total sequence length: 3,099,706,404  
  - hg19 total sequence length: 3,101,788,170  
  - difference in chromosome length btw hg38 and hg19: 2'081'766 bp  

- With your favorite gene, find out its position in hg38 and hg18.

  - hg38: OCA2 at chr15:27754875-28099315  
  - hg17: OCA2 at chr15:25673616-26018056  

> The USCS Genome Browser

* Show gene TP53 in the genome browser.
* Where is this gene? (chromosome, cytoband, and exact start and end positions)
  - Chromosome 17, cytoband 17p13.1, from chr17:7,668,421 to chr7:7,687,490, length 19,070 bp.  
  
* How many isoforms does it have?
  - 9 isoforms  

* How many exons does it have?
  - 12 exons (7 coding exons)  

* What the size of its longest exon? (roughly)
  - 1'300 bp  

* Find the three closest genes in upstream and downstream, respectively.
  - upstream: ATP1B2, SHBG, SAT2
  - downstream: WRAP53, DNAH2, EFNB3  

> Liftover

* Switch to hg19 and find TP53.
