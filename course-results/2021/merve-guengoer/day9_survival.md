# **Disease Classification Concepts**

## **ICD-10**
The ICD-10 is the abbreviation for 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems - 10th Revision of the Classification'. It is mostly used in clinics and contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. Compared to ICD-O it covers the whole range of diseases and does not only provide informations for the area of oncology. In ICD-10 the disease are subdivided into chapters according to the tissue/organ which is involved (e.g. adenocarcinoma of sigmoid colon has the code C18.7, which refers to the tissue/organ involved).

## **ICD-O**
ICD-O is the abbreviation for International Classification of Diseases for Oncology. It is mostly used by pathologists rather than in clinics as the ICD-10. The ICD-O provides two codes per cancer; one for the tumor histology (morpholgy) (e.g. 8140/3 for adenocarcinoma) and one for the tumor site (topography) (e.g. C18.7 for sigmoid colon). This provides te locations of the tumor, which is an advantages. The disadvantages of ICD-O are that there is no ontology and not really a hierarchy.

## **NCIt**
The NCI Thesaurus (NCIt), from the U.S. National Cancer Institute provides individual codes for site-specific occurences of biological diagnosis (e.g. NCIT:C43584 for rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma). It has a hierarchical ontology and the assignment of codes to different groupings allows soft aggregation, which is an advantages.

## **TNM**
The TNM is a Classification for Clinical Cancer Stage Parameters and is the most widely used cancer staging system. The letters of TNM describe 3 features of the detected cancer in a patient; T refers to the size and extent of the main tumor, N refers to the the number / location of nearby lymph nodes that have cancer infiltration and M refers to whether the cancer has metastasized. The staging system is only used for solid tumors and not used for leukemias or lymphomas.
