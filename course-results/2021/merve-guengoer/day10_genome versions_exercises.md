## **Introduction to Genome Versions**

### **Task 1: Reference Genome Variants**
1. Name and time of the latest version for 
* Human: GRCh38.p13; March 2019 
* Mouse: GRCm39; June 2020 
* E.Coli: ASM584v2; September 2013

2. Name and time of the first version for 
* Human: NCBI34/hg16; July 2003
* Mouse: NCBI35/mm7; August 2005
* E.Coli: ASM584v1; June 2004

3. How many reference genomes were released in total for 
* Human: 5
* Mouse: 5
* E Coli: 2

### **Task 2: Difference between genome versions**
1. Find out the difference in chromosome length between the latest patch of
hg38 and the last patch of hg19. 

hg19 patch 13 (latest): total length = 3,101,788,170 bp
hg38 patch 13 (latest): total length = 3,099,706,404 bp

=> The older patch has more total bp than the newest.

2. With your favorite gene, find out its position in hg38 and hg18.
=> looked for BRCA1
hg38 position: chr17:43044295-43125483
hg18 position: chr17:38449840-38530994

### **Task 3: UCSC Genome Browser**

1. Show gene TP53 in the genome browser.

2. Where is this gene? (chromosome, cytoband, and exact start and end
positions)

3. How many isoforms does it have?
4. How many exons does it have?
5. What the size of its longest exon? (roughly)
6. Find the three closest genes in upstream and downstream, respectively.
