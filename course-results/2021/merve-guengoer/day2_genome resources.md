## **Resources for (reference) genomes**
1. [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/)

The UCSC genome browser is originated from the Human Genome Project and the most widely used general genome browser. The browser allows us to search for specific genes by using for example the name or the position of the gene of interest. The browser provides a lot of detailed informations as the position of the gene of interest in the chromosome or the legth of it, to list only a few. Additionally, we can download an annotated data and sequence of our gene of interest.

>In my opinion, the website was not so easy to handle and too complicated at first sight. However, I think it is worth to take some time and learn how to handle the website, since it contains a lot of detailed informations when searching for genes, which could be usable for research reasons.

2. [Human Genome Resources at NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/human/)

The NCBI browser is an entry point for genome reference data and allows to look and visualize for different reference genomes. Seq. variants!

>The website was very inviting and structured and easier to handle than other browsers. What I really liked about it was, that it gives us a summary about the function of the gene we are looking for.

3. [ENSEMBL](http://www.ensembl.org/Human/Search/Results?q=;site=ensembl;facet_species=Human)

Ensembl is a genome browser for vertebrate genomes. The browser is able to annotate genes, compute multiple alignments and collect disease data. When looking for our gene of interest, the browser provides us a table of transcripts and the according proteins encoded in this regions. It is also possible to visualize the protein sequence and the sequence variants.

>The browser was in my opinion very clear and very structured. The handling was very easy and the visualization of the genes was very simple and not overfilled with informations.

4. [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic)

The COSMIC browser is a resource for exploring the impact of somatic mutations in human cancer. Typing the gene of interest in the search box delivers a table with with informations to analysed samples, mutations, PubMed publications and studies regarding the gene. The browser provides also very nicely informations to the gene, the drug resistance associated with mutations on the gene and the distribution of mutations accross tissue types.

>The website is very easy to handle and contains a lot of useful information for people working in the research area of cancer.
