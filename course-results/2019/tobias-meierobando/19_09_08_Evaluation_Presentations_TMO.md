| . | Strength | Improvement |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Frataxin | Nice presentation speed, very comfortable to listen | Fonts a bit bigger for people seating further in the back |
| ALAD | Clear and nice slides, very informative presentation | The speech flow was sometimes a bit disrupted.  |
| Glycine tRNA ligase| The mutation was very nicely explained | Very fast presentation at the beginning, sometimes a lot of information on one slide |
| SOD (Cu Zn) | Very nice overview of the disease | Could have been a bit more of information about the protein, the end was a bit cut off |
| DJ-1 | Good portion of information on each protein function | Some slides could have more information (first Parkinson) as a lot information was given without connection |
| SOD2 (Mn) | Good presentation speed, clear voice  | Sometimes the flow of the presentation was not quite clear, too much going back |
| H-RAS| Fancy GIF!  | Some of the figures could have used a better labeling |
