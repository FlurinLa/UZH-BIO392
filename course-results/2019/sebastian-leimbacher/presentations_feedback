ALAD
Very good: Good showcase of work that was done
Possible improvement: Overview not really needed imo (short presentation...), To make the presentation more fluid you might 
want to write the whole text and learn it by heart.

Clycine tRNA ligase
Very good: visualisation (p.ex. the conservation of the aa around the active site)
Possible improvement: You could explain the whole slide with wildtype & mutation or leave part of it out as if you show it, 
you need to explain it as you spark the interest of the hearers. Sometimes you had a lot of text on your slides.

SOD Cu-Zn
Very good: Good graphic about its function & explanation, overall very informativ presentation
Possible improvement: You should try to not block the beamer

DJ-1
Very good: Good visualisation of functions 
Possible improvement: You could skip some of the structure pictures or go faster over them as they are very similar. One was hard do see as not the 
whole protein was shown (maybe change up "fog").

SOD2 Mn
Very good: Good showcase of status quo of the research
Possible improvement: You should explain the graphic about diabetes or leave it out of your presentation.

H-Ras
Very good: Cool 3D animatio of H-Ras
Possible improvement: You could improve the presentation by not having to klick for every single sentence.
