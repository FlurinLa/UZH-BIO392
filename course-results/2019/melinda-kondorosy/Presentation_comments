Frataxin:

Very well structured presentation and well used images from the different databases. 
However, I think it would have been useful to hear a bit more about the relation between the mutation location and the catalytic/ active domain. 

ALAD:

The description of the disease was very informative and detailed. 
It would have been a nice addition to hear a bit more about the mutations and how they affect the protein or the disease.

Glycine tRNA ligase:

The phylogenic aspect of the protein fit very good into the presentation and gave a new aspect to the whole topic. 
There were a bit too much informations on the slides. 

DJ-1:

I enjoyed the nutshell slide. It gave a very good overview of the protein and the mutation as well. 
Perhaps the informations about the structure was a bit too much in detail.

SOD2: 

It was very interesting to hear more about the reaction mechanism and the open questions connected with it. However, perhaps the part about that turned out a bit too long compared to the other aspects.
Also it was cool to hear about your ups and downs throughout the last two weeks. 

H-Ras:

The animation of the protein was very cool. Also I liked that you mentioned the special position of the active site and its conversation. Overall, you mentioned a lot of useful and interesting details about the protein and the mutation. 
It would have been useful to explain a bit what a PolyPhen score is and what it means to have score of 1.000.
