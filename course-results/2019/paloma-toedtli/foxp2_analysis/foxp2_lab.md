### Function and biological processes 

Forehead box protein P2 is a transcriptional repressor that may play a role in the specification and differentiation of lung epithelium, as well as in development of many tissues. It is involved in the following processes :

- camera-type eye development
- caudate nucleus development
- cerebellum development
- cerebral cortex development
- innate vocalization behavior
- lung alveolus development
- negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated
- positive regulation of epithelial cell proliferation involved in lung morphogenesis
- positive regulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation
- post-embryonic development
- putamen development
- response to testosterone
- righting reflex
- skeletal muscle tissue development
- smooth muscle tissue development
- vocal learning



RefSeq is a comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant, well-annotated set of reference sequences including genomic, transcript, and protein.

The accession number of the transcript of human foxp2 is NM_014491.4, and the protein accession number is NP_055306.1. The sequence of the protein is downloaded in FASTA format to be used in Blastp.

The Pan troglodytes foxp2 accession number is NM_001009020.3, and the protein accession number is NP_001009020.1. The sequence of the protein is downloaded in FASTA format to be used in Blastp.

**Where is Foxp2 located in the cell?**

As it is a transcription factor it seems legit to find this protein in the nucleus.

**Which diseases is it involved in?**

It is involved in the Speech-language disorder 1 (SPCH1) caused by a SNV (R553H)
