Frataxin 
  clear an slow speech
  could work more with the pictures you show in the presentation

ALAD 
  good explanation of abstract mechanisms and structues
  May you can show a bit more enthusiasm during your presentation.

Glycine + RNA ligase 
  presentation was good structured. Easy to follow the talk.
  be aware of your velocity of your speak. (not too fast and not too slow)

SOD Cu-Zn 
  I really liked to listen to your talk. You catched 100% of my attention
  some less important facts were on the slides. keep in mind that less is more ;)

DJ-1 
  There is no need to be nervous ;) we are all more or less nice people in this room
  good visualisation of the protein and its variants.  

H-Ras  
  Cool protein animation! The whole presentation looks really nice and support to understand the topic.
  You could be a bit more like a story teller.
