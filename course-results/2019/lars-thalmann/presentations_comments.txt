Frataxin:
+ Strength	detailed and comprehensive overview of structure elements, pathways impaired in disease, etc.
- Improvement	some slides are a tad busy to look at (also, remove that damn cursor from the screen... ;) )


Glycine tRNA ligase:
+ Strength	good visualizations and descriptions
- Improvement	some slides kinda large "walls of text"; those could benefit from being summarized in more of a bullet point like fashion?


SOD Cu-Zn:
+ Strength	elaborate and engaging description of the subject without it feeling "bloated"
- Improvement	some repetition in some parts


DJ-1:
+ Strength	easy to follow visualisation for the structures
- Improvement	description of functions could be shortened to mainly describe ones relevant to the disease you focused on? (no one'll remember all of them a minute later, and you had plenty of material to fill the required time...)


SOD2 Mn:
+ Strength	detailed descriptions that make good sense of what might otherwise be rather hard to interpret illustrations
- Improvement	variants of the phrase "it's unclear" or "it's difficult to determine" are repeated a bit much, some perhaps overly elaborate descriptions (given the time limit)


H-Ras:
+ Strength	no cluttered slides (also, 3D animations are neat)
- Improvement	could improve fluidity in going over some slides
