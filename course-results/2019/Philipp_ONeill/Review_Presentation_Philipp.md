Review presentations, Philipp O'Neill


Group 1, Frataxin
+:
Because there was a clear structure, it was easy to follow the presentation

-:
There were a couple of slides that were a little too clustered.




Group 2, ALAD
+:
You balanced information density and time limit very well in your presentation.

-:
I think cards or a "cheat sheet" are very useful in presentations, however they may haven been a bit overused in this case.




Group 3, Glycine + RNA-ligase
+:
The presentation depicted the work that was done over the last three weeks very well and in a comprehensive manner.

-:
While the presentation was done very well, I think the slides could have been a bit better organised / Structured.




Group 4, SOD Cu-Zn
+:
Good presentation. Because my protein was SOD2 it was interesting to hear more details about SOD1

-:
I would have liked to hear more details about the catalytic mechanism in SOD1 to compare the differences to our protein.





Group 5, DJ-1
+:
The structural part was very intriguing. I also enjoyed the absolutely beautiful visualisations in the slides.

-:
While I did enjoy the presentation very much it may have been slightly more than ten minutes. I didn't time it, so this is just a bold but yet careful postulate on my part.




Group 7, H-Ras
+:
I liked the overall information content and the visual presentation of the slides was done very professionally.

-:
With such a solid presentation I think you could have shown a little more confidence at times.
