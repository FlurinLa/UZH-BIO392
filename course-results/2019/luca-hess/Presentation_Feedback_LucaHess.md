# Feedback for Presentations - Luca Hess

### Frataxin

+ Positive: Clear structure, mostly good information density (exceptions mentioned below). Nice slide-design.

+ Negative: Too much information on some slides. I don't think we need to see every single GO term for example, even if some are highlighted.

### ALAD

+ Positive: Good details overall, giving a good understanding of the relevant aspects. 

+ Negative: While the information was good and the presentation mostly fluid, reading off a note-card is something that could maybe be avoided.

### Glycine + RNA Ligase

+ Positive: Bringing in skills we learned in other activities (Log Plot, Phylogeny etc) to nicely complement the topic.

+ Negative: Effects of the mutation on structure and function are interesting to talk about, but the accompanying slide was overloaded with text.
Overall, I'd say there was a bit too much text per slides. (Also, reading off a note-card isn't ideal)

### Us: SOD1 Cu-Zn

### DJ-1

+ Positive: Good, energetic presentation. Mostly very good slide-design and information content. Good flow and sequence of information.

+ Negative: Toward the end, some of the slides contained a bit too much text. (Difficult to tell without a timer, but seemed a bit long.)

### SOD2 Mn

+ Positive: Nicely showing all the issues and open questions regarding the active site. Nice summary slide.

+ Negative: Some in this context probably superfluous information (actual binding site locations probably a bit much). 

### H-Ras

+ Positive: Fancy animations! The text appearing with the progress of the presentation of a slide was a nice way of showing written information as it became relevant.
A good way to prevent overloading the listener with information. Like other groups, I liked how you brought in some of the skills/ressources we learned during the activities (PolyPhen) to enhance your presentation.

+ Negative: A bit hesitant/non-fluent presentation in some parts (No reading off note-cards though, which is a plus!)
