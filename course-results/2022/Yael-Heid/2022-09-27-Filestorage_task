Storage Requirements for 1000 Genomes

Different file formats:
  - SAM (Alignments):
    Sequence Alignment Map - human readable text files
    
  
  - BAM:
    Binary Alignment Map - the binary and compressed equivalent to SAM
  
  - VCF (variants)
  
  - FASTA (Unaligned sequences):
    often used for reference Genomes
    stretches of DNA sequences encoded with A, G, C, T, N (Bases)
    > line contains name and the following lines contain the sequence
    example:
      >NC_009902.1 Babesia bovis T2Bo mitochondrion, complete genome
      TTTAAAAAAGTGTTAAAAACTTTATACATTAAAAAATTTAAACAAGTGATCATGTATAAAGTACACTTGT
      TACTGTGTAAATATCAAAAACAATTTAATTTCAAAATTTTTGAAATATGTTTTTTGTGTTGTGTTATAAA
      ...
      
  - FASTQ :
    is like FASTA but includes quality data as well (the line below the DNA sequence line)
    the quality is represented using Phred score for every single Base - encoded in different single letters and singns 
    these quality scores are logarithmically linked to error probabilities
      - a score of 10 is 1 in 10 - Base call accuracy of 90%
      - a score of 20 is 1 in 100 - Base call accuracy of 99%
      - a score of 50 is 1 in 100'000 - Base call accuracy of 99.999%
    
    example:
      @SRR001666.1 071112_SLXA-EAS1_s_7:5:1:817:345 length=36
