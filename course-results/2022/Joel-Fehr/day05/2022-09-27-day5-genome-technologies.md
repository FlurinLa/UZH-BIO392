# Task02 Reading up on Genome Technologies

## General NGS Technologies

NGS stands for *Next generation sequencing*. As itâ€˜s name implies it represents the new way of sequencing and it is much fast than than old technologies like Sanger sequencing.

### Principle NGS[^1]

  - *Fragmentation*:  DNA fragments are generated. Can be achieved with centrifugation or enzymes.
  - *Adaptation*: Specific oligonucleotides are bound to the fragments and a DNA library is generated.
  - *Amplification*: The DNA fragments are amplified and clusters of identical DNA is generated. In these clusters the actual sequencing takes place. Parallel sequencing is possible with this method.

## Dig deeper

### banding analysis[^2]

With the help of banding analysis a series of landmarks across the length of the metaphase can be produced. This then allows for recognition of individual chromosomes and identification of specific segments of the chromosome.

### SNP[^3], aCGH arrays[^4]

SNP array is a type of microarray. It is used to detect polymorphisms. SNP are the most frequent type of variation in a genenome.

Array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (Array-CGH) is a method for simultanous hybridization of fluorescent marked DNA on a chip with DNA fragments.

### SKY, M-FISH[^5]

Spectral karyotyping (SKY) and multiplex-FISH (M-FISH) allow the visualization of chromosome pairs in a different color at the same time.

### chromosomal CGH[^6]

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method. With the help of it one can analyse copy number variations relative to ploidy level in the DNA. A test sample is compared with a reference DNA. No culturing of cells is needed.
