# Task: Estimate Storage Requirements for 1000 Genomes
## How much computer storage is required for 1000 Genomes?

### WES and WGS
1000 whole genomes are 1/1400 petabyte which is 714.3 Gigabyte

### Different formats:
SAM
BAM: A single 30x BAM file is 100 GB. 
VCF 
FASTA
FASTQ: For a whole genome

### Associated costs
To store 1000 genomes in BAM cists about 50000 CHF, but only about half of this is for the raw storage.
Other cost factors are for example duplication and facilities.

### Familiarize with VCF format: specification in article collection
