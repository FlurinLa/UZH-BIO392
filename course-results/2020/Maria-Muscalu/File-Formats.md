### Exploration of variant annotation formats

#### 1. International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN)

  The discribtion of the chromosomal changes, which are detected using microscopic and cytogenetic methods, is based on the ISCN guidelines [[1]]. One of the key points of this nomenclature is that, it ilustrates the structure of the chromosomes [[2]]. The ISCN format uses a variaty of symbols and abbreviations, which are all summarized by the [Coriell Institute for medical research](https://www.coriell.org/0/Sections/Support/Global/iscn_help.aspx?PgId=263). The [Sequence Variant Nomenclature](https://varnomen.hgvs.org/recommendations/DNA/variant/complex/) website, also points out some of the specific symbols and their use to describe the chromosomes. For example, *pter* and *qter* indicate the start and the end of the chromosomes respectively, while *cen* represents the centromere [[2]]. Other symbols like *sup* inform about the presence of an additiona sequence while *::* indicate the location of a break and formation of a ring chromosome [[2]]. The information given by ISCN focuses chromosomal translocations, invertions, delitions or insertions, as well as additional chromosomes [[2]].
> chr2:g.pter_8,247,756::chr11:g.15,825,273_cen_qter (der11) and chr11:g.pter_15,825,272::chr2:g.8,247,757_cen_qter (der2)

The previous line indicates an example for a balanced translocation between chromosome two and 11, following the ISCN recomandations [[2]].
