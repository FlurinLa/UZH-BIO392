### Exploration of variant annotation formats

#### 1. International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN)

  The discribtion of the chromosomal changes, which are detected using microscopic and cytogenetic methods, is based on the ISCN guidelines [[1]]. One of the key points of this data base is that it describes the structure of the chromosomes [[2]]. The ISCN format uses a variaty of symbols and abbreviations, which were all summarized by the [Coriell Institute for medical research [3]](https://www.coriell.org/0/Sections/Support/Global/iscn_help.aspx?PgId=263).
