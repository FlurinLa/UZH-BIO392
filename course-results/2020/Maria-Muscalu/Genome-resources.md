### [Cancer Genome Interpreter](https://www.cancergenomeinterpreter.org/home)

This website allows the analysis of alterations of tumor genes samples. It also has some example tumor genes, which can be analysed to see the results format. In addition, four different data sets can be found: cancer biomarkers, validated oncogenic mutations, cancer genes and cancer bioactivities.  

### [NCBI:dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/docs/entrez_help/)

The SNP data base  indicates the change in the nucleotides for a given allele. In addition, it also provides information about the location on the Chromosome, the gene (which shows the map with all the different SNPs for that gene), the consequences of these mutations (e.g. missense_variant), its clinical significance and other more detailed information.

### [The Clinical Knowledgebase (CKB)](https://ckb.jax.org/)

First of all the website can be used to look up the function and location on the chromosome of a gene. Secondly, the data base also has a collection of gene 
variants. For each variant, there are more categories where the data is grouped. For example, the gene level evidence group informs about the molecular profile, tumor type, response type, treatment approaches, therapy name, approval status, evidence type, efficacy evidence and references. Amongst other things, the website can also indicate the gene variant associated clinical trials. 

### [My Cancer Genome](https://www.mycancergenome.org/)

This website is different from the others, since here you can insert the name of the gene of interest (e.g. IL7). The page then returns all the information (which is grouped in biomarkers, diseases, drugs, clinical trials and pathways) from the data base connected to this gene.
