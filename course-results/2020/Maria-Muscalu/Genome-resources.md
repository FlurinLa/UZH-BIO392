### Cancer Genome Interpreter

This website allows the analysis of alterations of tumor genes samples. It also has some example tumor genes, which can be analysed to see the results format.
In addition, four different data sets can be found: cancer biomarkers, validated oncogenic mutations, cancer genes and cancer bioactivities.  

### NCBI:dbSNP
The SNP data base  indicates the change in the nucleotides for a given allele. 
In addition, it also provides information about the location on the Chromosome, the gene (which shows the map with all the variations), 
the consequences of these mutations, its clinical significance and other more detailed information.
