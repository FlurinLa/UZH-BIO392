|Year | Who | Description |
|-----|-----|:------------|
|1965|Robert Holley|Whole nucleic acid sequence of alanine tRNA.|
|1965|Fred Sagner|Method is used to detect radiolabeled partial-digestion fragments after two dimentional fractionation. This helped with the sequencing of ribosomal and transfer RNA.|
|1972|Walter Fiers' laboratory|They used the two dimentional fragmentation method to sequence the first complete protein coding dene.|
||Ray Wu and Dale Kaiser|They added to ends radioactive nucleotides using a DNA polymerase. The sequence was examined by giving the nucleotides one at a time and measuring their incorporation.|
|1970s|Alan Coulson and Sanger|Plus and Minus system: A two second polymerisation reaction could be done with this technique using a DNA polymerase, which incorporated radiolabelled nucleotides to a primer. During the 'plus' reaction a single type of nucleotide could be added and the sequence stopped at the present nucleotide. The 'minus' reaction is the exact opposite, because three nucleotides were added and the sequencing stoped before the missing nucleotide. The products from these reactions were run in a polyacryamide gel.|
