|Year | Who | Description |
|-----|-----|:------------|
|1965|Robert Holley|Whole nucleic acid sequence of alanine tRNA.|
|1965|Fred Sagner|Method is used to detect radiolabeled partial-digestion fragments after two dimentional fractionation. This helped with the sequencing of ribosomal and transfer RNA.|
|1972|Walter Fiers' laboratory|They used the two dimentional fragmentation method to sequence the first complete protein coding dene.|
||Ray Wu and Dale Kaiser|They added to ends radioactive nucleotides using a DNA polymerase. The sequence was examined by giving the nucleotides one at a time and measuring their incorporation.|
|1970s|Alan Coulson and Sanger|Plus and Minus system: A two second polymerisation reaction could be done with this technique using a DNA polymerase, which incorporated radiolabelled nucleotides to a primer. During the 'plus' reaction a single type of nucleotide could be added and the sequence stopped at the present nucleotide. The 'minus' reaction is the exact opposite, because three nucleotides were added and the sequencing stopped before the missing nucleotide. The products from these reactions were run in a polyacryamide gel.|
|1975|Maxam and Gilbert|They also used the polyacrylamide gel but for their experiments radiolabelled DNA was treated with chemicals to break the sequence at specific bases. The length was determined using the gel.|
|1977|Sagner|'Chain termination' or dideoxy technique: for this technique dideoxynucleotides ddNTPs are used, which lack the 3' hydroxyl group. After one ddNTP is incorporated into the new sequence, no further nucleotides can be added. The length of the strands is measured using the polyacrylamide gel.|

The machines used for tese techniques can produce readouts less than one kilobase.

###### Sequencing machines produced by 454.
Using adapter sequences, DNA libraries can be attached to beads. Afterwards, the beads are placed in a water-in-oil emulsion PCR (emPCR) and the initial DNA library is amplified. DNA-coated beads are washed over a plate that fits one beat per well. The pyrosequencing step occures when enzymes linked to smaller beads and dNTP are added. Pyrophosphate is then measured using a charged couple device.
