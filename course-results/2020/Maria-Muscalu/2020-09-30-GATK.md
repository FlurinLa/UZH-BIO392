#### **1. We see a Câ†’T variant light up in red for the tumor but not the normal. What do you think is happening in 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam?**

This indicates the difference in nucleotides between the sequences. All normal sample reads have in this place a C nucleotide and the point mutation (from C to T) appears in all the reads from the cancer samples. This might indicate one reason for the cancer phenotype.

#### **2. What are the three grouped tracks for the bamout? What do the colors indicate? What differentiates the pastel versus gray reads?**

The bamout tracks contain the artificial haplotypes and reassembled alignments for the tumoral and normal samples. The colors indicate the different haplotypes. The pastel read is a haplotype while the gray one is not.
