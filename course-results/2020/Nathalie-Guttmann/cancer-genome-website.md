##Cosmic:
+ 3d structure of  protein with cancer mutation site: potential change of structural change( protein; ligand etc…), info about selected mutation( effect , type of change, combinatorial impacts
-difficult to understand if no idea what you re looking for or not familiar with this type of research






##Iccc:
+ selection by jurisdiction of organs
+get idea of national study on specific organ, number of patients
+visual information, clear, easy to read info about each mutation, maybe good for first approach(maybe not deep enough)
- English speaking country mostly represented( not many others)
+select donors by specific parameters(age, disease status, primary site, tumour stage etc…)




##Pmkb.weill.cornell.edu:
- strange website design
-page almost empty, not  really visual
-not much info about mutation-> linked to ensemble for more info
