### UCSC Genome Browser

Selection and Exploration of specific assembly
Species genomes can be selected by entering species, common name or by choosing the specie on a phylogenetic tree.
After the selection of the desired specie, more information  (e.g NCBI Assenbly ID, Assembly date...) are depicted for the assembly. This website also allows you to download an annotated data and sequence using different transfer protocols(e.g HTTP). Additonally more information (genes and genes prediction, trancript track, variants and comparative genomics) on specific sequence of the assembly can be found by clicking on 'view the assembly'. 
In my opinion, this website gives the possibility to find a wide range of information on the same platform , however it might be difficult to retrieve information or interpret results if someone is a beginner.




###Cosmic:

Exploration Cosmic-3D:
This project allows us to visual and understand  mutations in a 3D protein structure. Interesting is that the structural illustration (protein, ligand,binding sites) of the chosen protein/gene can be manually altered depending on what you are interesting in. It also gives you information on  protein sequence features and selected mutation (e.g effect, type of change, combinatorial impacts etc...)
This part of Cosmic website is interactive and it's fun to play around with the structural properties of the protein and its mutations, however results might not always be useful to answer a specific question and so you might have to go back to the Cosmic's initial website.






##Icgc:
On international Cancer Geneome Consortium website, you can find information about cancer project all around the world. It seems to me that this website is more a collection of information on projects rather than a website such UCSC etc.., where you can actively change/ explore assemblies in many different ways. 
I liked the idea that information on projects can either be chosen by the tumor type or the juridiction. I noticed that most of projects are mainly from english-speaking countries, few ones are from Europe and that none were represented by Africa. Also interesting is that donors can be classified by specifc parameters( age, disease status, primary site, tumor stage etc...).
In summary, results on this website were easy to understand/ interpret as most of them were quite visual and not that complex, however for more detailed information you are refered to other websites.
