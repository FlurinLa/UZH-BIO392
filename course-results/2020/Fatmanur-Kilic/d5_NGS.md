# General NGS Technologies [1](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/ebi-next-generation-sequencing-practical-course/what-you-will-learn/what-next-generation-dna-)
Next-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing, is the catch-all term used to describe a number of different modern sequencing technologies. These technologies allow for sequencing of DNA and RNA much more quickly and cheaply than the previously used Sanger sequencing, and as such revolutionised the study of genomics and molecular biology.
## Illumina (Solexa) sequencing
Illumina sequencing works by simultaneously identifying DNA bases, as each base emits a unique fluorescent signal, and adding them to a nucleic acid chain. 100-150bp reads are used.
## Roche 454 sequencing
This method is based on pyrosequencing, a technique which detects pyrophosphate release, again using fluorescence, after nucleotides are incorporated by polymerase to a new strand of DNA. Roche 454 sequencing can sequence much longer reads than Illumina.
## Ion Torrent: Proton / PGM sequencing
Ion Torrent sequencing measures the direct release of H+ (protons) from the incorporation of individual bases by DNA polymerase and therefore differs from the previous two methods as it does not measure light. As in other kinds of NGS, the input DNA or RNA is fragmented, this time ~200bp. Adaptors are added and one molecule is placed onto a bead.
# Count based vs. intensity based as principle
