# Different File Formats
Here is a brief introduction of different genomic file formats and their use cases.

## SAM (Sequence Alignment Map)
- **TAB-delimited text format**<sup>1</sup>
- human readable
- often generated of BAM
- stores biological **sequences aligned**<sup>2</sup> to a reference sequence

## BAM  (Binary Alignment Map)
- binary
- compressed version of SAM

## CRAM
- binary
- columnar file format
- more compressed than BAM

## VCF

## FASTA

## MPEG-G








-------------
**1** contains tabs that separate information with one record per line.

**2** a sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences. *(wikipedia)*
