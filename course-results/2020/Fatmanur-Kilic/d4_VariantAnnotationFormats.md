# Variant Annotation Formats
Here is a briefly summary of genomic variant formats and their use cases.

## ISCN (International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature)
- international standard for human chromosome nomenclature
- covers the description of numerical and structural chromosomal changes detected using microscopic and cytogenetic techniques
- includes band names, symbols and abbreviated terms used in the description of human chromosome and chromosome abnormalities
- examples for symbols [2](http://www.slh.wisc.edu/clinical/cytogenetics/basics/):
  - *del* Deletion
  - *dic* Dicentric chromosome
  - *inv* Inversion
  - *t* Translocation
 - example for usage:
    - 46,XX,t(1;2)(p32;q22) means 46 chromosomes, female (XX sex chromosomes), with a balanced translocation between chromosomes 1 and 2 with breakpoints in the short arm of chromosome 1 at band 1p32 and the long arm of chromosome 2 at band 2q22.
