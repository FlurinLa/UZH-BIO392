# Resources for Genomics
There are several websites which represent whether germline or somatic genomics. One of the somatic genomics resources is **COSMIC** (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer)

### What information do you get when you search for e.g. *KRAS* gene?

#### Gene view and Overview
In the gene view section, you'll see a histogram which is a graphical view of mutations across KRAS. The **overview** section gives an overview of KRAS, along with links to any related data and resources.

#### Tissue distribution
In this section, you'll see a table which shows the distribution of mutations across the primary tissue types.

#### Mutation distribution
This section displays a series of charts that show the distribution of different types of mutations for KRAS. 

##### Some facts about KRAS
- It's is an oncogene.
- 99% of detected mutations in 45430 samples are *missense substitutions*. 
- KRAS is a census gene, which means it's a known cancer gene.
- It's also a hallmark gene [click here] (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/census-page/KRAS) for further information about its effects on hallmarks.
