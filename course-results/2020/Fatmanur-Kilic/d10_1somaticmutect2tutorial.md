1. We see a Câ†’T variant light up in red for the tumor but not the normal. What do you think is happening in 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam?
While the normal cells have C, tumor cells have T instead of C at this position. It has high coverage, which means this mutation has an effect on tumor development.

2. What are the three grouped tracks for the bamout? What do the colors indicate? What differentiates the pastel versus gray reads?
