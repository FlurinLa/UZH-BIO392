1. We see a Câ†’T variant light up in red for the tumor but not the normal. What do you think is happening in 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam?

While the normal cells have C, tumor cells have T instead of C at this position. T has a high coverage, which means this mutation has an effect on tumor development. 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam also shows that the base at this positin is 60% T (from tumor sample), 40% C (from normal tissue).   

2. What are the three grouped tracks for the bamout? What do the colors indicate? What differentiates the pastel versus gray reads?
