# Estimated Storage Requirements for 1000 Genomes
## WES (Whole Exome Sequencing) & WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing)
**WGS**: all DNA, 3.1 billion base pairs
**WES**: protein-coding DNA only, 31 million base pairs, 1-2% of the whole genome

The amount of sequence needed for a 100X exome sample is ~5-6Gb, substantially less than the ~90Gb needed for WGS.
