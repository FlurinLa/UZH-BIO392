# :octocat: Genome Resources


### Sites I looked at:

For all of these, I decided to look at a single gene, and (more or less randomly) I chose BRCA1 for this.  
The sites I checked out were:
- [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&lastVirtModeType=default&lastVirtModeExtraState=&virtModeType=default&virtMode=0&nonVirtPosition=&position=chr17%3A43044295%2D43125483&hgsid=242736546_26ej8VXpqdowdYheDcvG8x9F9vuq)
- [ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000012048;r=17:43044295-43170245)
- [cosmic](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/gene/analysis?ln=BRCA1)
- [ClinGen](https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/genes/HGNC:1100/external_resources_genes)


### Observations

First of all: I don't really know what to do with all this. I can see lots of information, know what some of it means and can make informed guesses
on some more, but largely need more info. I can see that there is lots of knowledge to be found there, but until I am looking for some piece of info
and can experience how to find it on these sites, I don't know what is important.  
I did notice that ClinGen stands out as a recource that would possibly be useful for doctors to properly interpret findings about things that show up when they
sequenced a patients DNA for some test. It seems to focus on informing on how meaningful the finding of some variant in such cases is, and gives a short overview
of the topic with lots of links to more detailed information.  
All of the others I looked at seem to (at least from this first look) be more suited for research applications. I quite liked cosmic, because it seemed to contain more varied
information on top of the genome browser itself.  
The most interesting part about the UCSC browser to me was the comparison between the human genome with various other animals right there and by default. That feature might give
a good sense of roughly how far a marker or gene might be spread throughout the animal kingdom. And it's just fun. Other thatn that though, USCS's browser seems like one of the
more complex ones to use, and it also shows only the browser without much additional info (that I could find). If you know what you're doing, this resource might
be a treasure trove of knowledge, but currently it seems the hardest to use out of the ones I looked at.  
Lastly, ensembl seems to be somewhere between UCSC and cosmic regarding the amount of additional info on top of the browser.


### Conclusion

Honestly, I don't really know what to do with my observations yet. I can't really quantify what the implications of the differences I noticed are for various
use cases, and I don't doubt for a second that I barely scrached the surface of what these resources can do for someone that knows what he is looking for and how to look for it.
