# Chapter 1


## Text-only interfaces (CLI) vs graphical interfaces (GUI)(e.g. Gnome, KDE, xfce, etc.)

--> The X Window System (X11) allows execution of programs with graphical interfaces.


## The kernel

The operating system kernel manages the computer's resources, such as the central processing unit (or "CPU"), the memory, all input/output (I/O) devices, etc.,
and allows other programs to run and use these resources.


## The shell

The shell program - also known as a Command Line Interpreter (CLI), is a text-only interface between the user and the kernel.
Its main function is to read the commands that are typed in the terminal window by the user and execute them.


## The programs

In addition to external programs that can be installed on the computer, UNIX or UNIX-like operating systems come with many built-in command-line interface programs
and shell utilities
--> The OS manages user actions and user applications. However, access to hardware resources are performed via the kernel


## GNU/Linux project: Fusion of two distinct projects

The Linux Kernel  - by Linus Torvalds (1991), which was missing UNIX-like applications
The GNU project, which created UNIX-like libraries and applications, but was missing a mature kernel.


## prompt

The prompt is a symbol or a series of characters at the beginning of a line


## The X window system (also known as X11)

is a computer software system and network protocol that provides a basis for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and
rich input device capability for networked computers.


## unix-server:~ userA$ tr " " "\\n" < go-data.csv | grep ^GO: | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

-tr' to transform all the spaces ' ' - note the space between the quotes - into a newline character '\\n'
-'tr' command is executed using the content of the go-data.csv file.
-the '|' symbol is called 'pipe' in UNIX. It allows to directly pass the output from one program to the input of another without creating intermediate or temporary files.
 In this case, the result of the 'tr' command will be given as input to the next command
-the 'grep' command - for Global Regular Expression Parser - searches for words or patterns and displays the result lines.
Here we want to retrieve only the lines that start - note the '^' - with the pattern 'GO'
-sort the remaining lines
-remove duplicates using the 'uniq' command 
-count how many times each line is repeated with the '-c' option
-using the previous data, sort the numbers in reverse order, largest first - 'sort -nr'
-display only the first ten lines using the 'head' command



# Chapter 2


## Organization of the filesystem

single root directory --> sub directories(top-down tree):
/bin: executable files available to all users
/dev: device drivers - screen, keyboard, disks, etc.
/etc: administrative and information files
/home: users home - or private - directories.
/lib: shared library files
/mnt or /media: common place to mount external media - hard disks, CD/DVD ROM, USB keys, etc.
/tmp: used by many programs as a temporary file storage place
/usr: originally intended to keep all user-related commands. Nowadays, it is used for miscellaneous purposes.

Absolute path: starts at the root '/' and shows the path - the way - to reach the file
Relative path: starts at the current - working - directory and shows the path - the way - to reach the file

Every directory has two special sub directories:
-The current directory or working directory, refers to the directory you are in when executing a command.
 ./angelina.jpg ('.' means current directory) is equivilent to ./././angelina.jpg
-The parent directory, refers to the directory in which a sub directory is cataloged. '..'


## Mount points

extenal device (e.g. USB stick) gets mounted by operating system
--> Mounting is the inclusion of an additional filesystem to the currently accessible filesystem of a computer.
the specific directory is called mount point
'/media' directory is used a lot as the mount point for removable media filesystem


##Case sensitivity

The command line differenciates upper from lower case letters


## File extensions

Under UNIX, however, file extensions are arbitrary and do not have a particular meaning
conventions:
.sh	shell scripts
.pl	perl scripts 
.py	python scripts

.txt	text files
.csv	text files with Comma-Separated Values
.fasta	text files containing sequences in FASTA format


## users and access rights:

user, group, others; read, write, execute



# Chapter 3


## commands

command -x -y --option other_parameters
'-' for short and '--' for long options
-a or --all display all files (including hidden ones)
-l , uses a long listing format, including the access rights (e.g. 'ls -l')
-h or --human-readable , prints file and directory sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)
-t , sorts by modification time - the default sorting is the filename
-r , reverses the order while sorting
note: '~' means 'home directory'
In UNIX, we can often group the options and use only one '-'. For instance:
uname -s -p is equivalent to uname -sp
'id' prints our userid, username, primary groupid, primary group name and secondary group(s) id number and name
man uname for on-line manual pages of uname (press space for next site)
note: The date for cal stops in December 9999 - UNIX users already knew that the world would not end December 21, 2012!
date
cal
who
whoami
history
pwd
'cd' change directory
'ls' list
'ps' lists the processes including their respective PID
'jobs -l ' lists background and suspended processes including their job id, their PID, their status - Running/Stopped - and the command line info.
... see cheat sheet


## processes

A process is an executing - or running - program identified by a unique process identifier (PID)
process can run fore or -background, be suspended or killed
processes are also called allocation units
calling process is given a parent process ID - PPID - by the system


## Threads

is a light weight process or 'unit of execution' contained in a process (within same environment) 


## Cores (CPU)

Execution parts of CPU were dublicated and reorganized into cores which allows multithreading	


## two ways to run a process in the background

-adding an ampersand '&' at the end of the command
-suspending a process running in the foreground - hold down the [CTRL] key and press 'z' - before putting it in the background using the bg command
 e.g. sleep 10 --> [CTRL+z] (which suspends) --> bg (for putting in background)


## terminating a process
in foreground: [CTRL+c]
in background: kill followed by either '% + job id' or 'PID'



# Chapter 4


## wildcard characters

* matches any number of characters (none, one or more) in a file or directory name (e.g. 'ls -l *.txt' lists all files ending with '.txt')
? matches exactly one character - use '??' to match any group of 2 characters (e.g.  'ls -l angelina?.jpg' --> angelina1.jpg, angelina2.jpf,...) 
[] - square brackets, specify a range of characters allowed at that position - use '!' to exclude a range of characters at that position (e.g. 'ls -l angelina[!5-9].jpg')
{} - curly brackets, specify a list of terms - separated by commas (e.g. 's -l {*.jpg,*.jpeg,*.gif,*.png'})
e.g. 'ls -l *.*[!txt]' all files not ending on .txt


## ls -l

output example: 
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 abc abc 4096 Sep 16 13:27 UZH-BIO392
drwxr-xr-x 1 abc abc 4096 Sep 17 10:29 course

'-' indicates an ordinary file type, 'd' indicates a directory,  'l' indicates a link
'r' indicates read permission, 'w' indicates write permission, 'x' indicates execution permission


## modifying access

'chmod' <ownership> '+/-/=' <access>
<ownership> with u , g , o or a (a = ugo)
'+' to give '-' to take '=' to set
<access> 'r', 'w', 'x' (e.g. 'r-x' the group members are granted reading and executÃ¯ng permissions, but not writing / modifying
e.g. 
'chmod g+w *.txt'
'chmod go-rwx *.*[!txt]'
--> grant group users write access to the files with the '.txt' extension, but remove any access (group + others) to all the other files


## file organization

'mkdir' make (new) direction
'mv' move to (e.g.  (1) 'mv {*.jpg,*.jpeg,*.gif,*.png} Pictures' for moving all of then into (existing) folder (on same level)
or (2)'mv Pictures ..' for moving in parent (one level up) direction or (3) 'mv vows.txt vows_draft.txt' for renaming a file or a directory)
'cp' copy (to new name or directory)
'rm' remove file, link, etc. ('-f' (force)ignores nonexistent files, never prompts for user confirmation; '-r' (recursively) removes directories and their contents)
'rmdir' remove directory (must be empty)


## note: link = alias = shortcut


## archiving data

'tar' creates, updates, expands archives
-z, or --gzip, compresses using gzip
-c, or --create, creates an archive
-x, or --extract, extracts from an archive
-t, or --list, display archive content
-v, or --verbose, displays information on the terminal window
-f, or --file, uses specified file



# Chapter 5


## Files

'find' for finding files
-name
-type, which can be: f, for regular files; d, for directories; l, for symbolic links.
-size n, n indicates the units of space, which can be expressed in: c, for bytes; k, for Kilobytes; M, for Megabytes and G, for Gigabytes - to show only some.

'file' to determine file type

'wc' (word count) for file statistics
-l, print the number of lines  
-w, print the number of words
-c, print the number of bytes
-m, print the number of characters
-L, print the length of the longest line


## Display files content

'head' prints the first 10 lines (can be modified with e.g. '-5' for first five lines)
'tail' like head but the last bit
'cat' displays file content on the terminal window
'less' text viewer (no editing possible)


## File input/output redirections

'stdout' stream where programs write their ouput data to (terminal by default)

'tdin' stream programs receive data from (keyboard by default)
redirect the input of a command, use '<' 
'sort' sorts lines of text file(s) alphanumerically (e.g. sort < ID_B.txt (ID_B.txt gets not modified!; sort ID_A.txt ID_B.txt ID_C.txt, * will not work)
-u or --unique', discards duplicates
-n or --numeric-sort, compares according to string numerical value
-r or --reverse, reverses the output
--> [CTRL+d] to print on terminal
'cat ID_A.txt ID_C.txt' >> myID.tx will sort both files and save to myID.tx

'stderr' stream used by programs to output error messages

'|' (pipe)  used to pass directly the output from one program to the input of another without creating intermediate or temporary files
--> sort -u Id_1.txt | wc -l (Without the '| wc -l', the output of 'sort -u' is printed on the terminal window)


## File format and newline character

newline character
'\n' Unix & all Unix flavors (unix does not handle other than /n)
'\r' Mac OS
'\r\n' Windows OS

'dos2unix' convert text files into a regular UNIX format (e.g. 'dos2unix -c Mac -n uniprot-mouse+virus.csv uniprot-mouse+virus.ok.csv')

'tr' translates or deletes characters (e.g. tr -d '\r' < uniprot-mouse+virus.csv for deleting all '/r' or '[a-z]' '[A-Z]' for transforming)


## Filtering file content


'diff' compares two files 
-b, ignores changes in amount of white space
-B, ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines
-s, reports when two files are the same - by default there is no report when two files are identical
-q, reports only whether two files differ, no details of the differences


'grep' (Global Regular Expression Parser) searches file(s) for words or patterns
-c displays the number of resulting lines instead of the result lines themselves
-i performs a case insensitive search of the pattern
-v displays lines that do not match the pattern
-n adds the line number in front of the result lines
-r search all files recursively under each directory
... man grep!
e.g. 'grep 'course' vows_draft.txt' shows the lines containing the word 'course' in the file 'vows.draft.exe'
e.g. 'grep -c '^ID ' uniprot-mouse+virus.txt' ('^' character means 'all the lines that _start_ with',  '.' character means any character,
 '$' character means 'all the lines that _end_ with', there are more regular expressions)

'cut' extract selected parts of lines from each line of input 
-c selection is done based on characters
-f selection is done based on fields. Usually a number or a range is provided.
-d fields are splitted according to the specified delimiter. The default delimiter is 'tab'
e.g. 'cut -d "," -f 1-3,5 uniprot-mouse+virus.ok.csv | head -5' for displaying some fields from a csv file - add the delimiter

'uniq' reports files (one line if identical and adjacent) --> typically used after sort
-d outputs only the duplicate lines
-c precedes each reported line with the number of occurrences
-i ignores the differences in case when comparing the lines
