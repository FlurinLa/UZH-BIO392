# Notes on some databases

## Cancer Genome Interpreter

* Relatively easy to navigate, color-coding helps with readability.
* The cancer biomarkers database contains lots of data on the effects of biomarkers on the effectiveness of a certain drug.
* Catalog of validated oncogenic mutations contains data on specific nucleotide- and protein-changes that have an effect on the risk or development of cancer.
  * There is (more or less) an even split between mutations in somatic cells and germline-specific mutations. I'm not sure why, but I expected more somatic mutations.
  
## COSMIC

* COSMIC has a lot of information: Some clicking and scrolling required, but still relatively straight forward.
* Impressive amounts of detail, down to an integrated "sequence viewer".

* Cancer gene census is an interesting collection of genes implicated in cancer.
* Some more variables than Cancer Genome Interpreter, but also a bit harder to navigate.
* "Breakdown" section below the main table is a nice way to find categories of cancer genes (such as missense mutations, germline mutations, ...).
* "Abbreviations" section is good to have and helps make sense of the table, but a tooltip like in Cancer Genome Interpreter would be less cumbersome to use.

## CiViC

* Uses some kind of evidence-rating system which is not completely clear to me.
* "Statistics" section contains some interesting stats on the whole database.
  * Section on Evidence has a filter to display stats of a subset of the complete data. Why no filters for the other sections (drugs, diseases, ...)? 
  
## PMKB

* Way less information on screen, which makes browsing less confusing.
* It feels like more clicking is required to find something specific.
* Organization of the data is less straight forward than in other databases. All the pages tend to look about the same, so browsing is a bit confusing at times.
