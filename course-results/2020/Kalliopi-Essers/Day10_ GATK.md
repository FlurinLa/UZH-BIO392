## GATK
### What is the value of using a matched normal control?

### We see a Câ†’T variant light up in red for the tumor but not the normal. What do you think is happening in 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam?
> In comparisation to the referene sequence the tumor shows a mutation of C-> T that is highlithet red to see it better and work with that. The normal cells have the same sequence therefor there is no need for highlight.

### What does the coverage tell you?
> A high coverage indicate a commomn findig of the strain.

### What are the three grouped tracks for the bamout? What do the colors indicate? What differentiates the pastel versus gray reads?
> * The first group (HC) contains the new "reference", which we cratet here to aligne  everything to the new assembly in this region. Then the normal and the tumor cell line.
> * The colors are to indicate the diffrent haplotypes.
> * The grey reads are in comparison to the pastel ones not important or reads that do not show interesting differences.

### How do you feel about this somatic call?
> Good, everything is pretty clear.
