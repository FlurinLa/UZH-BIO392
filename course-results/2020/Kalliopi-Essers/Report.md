> * In Bioinformatics we use the terminal to control a computer with text based commands.

> ##### What is a plain text file?
> * a plain text file is written in English using the alphabet and common punctuation marks.

> ##### In bioinformatics, most of the data are stored in plain text files with added syntax/structure (and commonly compressed afterwards). For instance, fasta or fastq files we have discussed them today, but also SAM, BED, GTF, VCF and others (to be discussed next week). Why is that?
