> # File types and their use

> ### VCF File
>   [Variant Call Format File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format#Common_FORMAT_fields)
>
> ##### Requirements
>         * Chromosome number
>         * Reference position 
>         * SNP or Cosmic ID
>
> ##### For what is it for?
>      * to Store gene sequence variations for large-scale genotyping and DNA sequencing projects
>
> ##### Dis- /Advantage
>      * By using the variant call format only the variations need to be stored along with a reference genome.
>
> ### SAM and BAM
>    [Sequence Alignment Map](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/)
>    [Binary Alignment Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format))
>
> ##### For what?
>       * for storing biological sequences aligned to a reference sequence.
>       * or storing data, such as nucleotide sequences, generated by next generation sequencing technologies.
> ##### SAM vs. BAM
>       * BAM is the binary equivalent of a SAM, which stores the same data in a compressed binary representation
>
> ### FASTA Format
> ##### For what?
>       * for representing either nucleotide sequences or amino acid (protein) sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes.
