## Some thoughts on different resources

* I searched for DNMT3A on each databank for funsies :)

<ol>
<li>BUCSC Genome Browser</li>
  <p> (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) </p>
  
> Easy to find genes if you know their name. However on first glance it's a lot of information and quite detailed,
so it takes some time to find information on e.g. the genes location. 
Additionally I couldn't find a way to download the gene sequence (Fasta oe.) Nevermind I found it.
Conclusion: Looks complicated at first but ok to navigate after some time. A lot of extra information available!
  
<li>Human Genome Resources at NCBI</li>
  <p>(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/human/)<p>
  
> Much more overview on first glance and I've used NCBI before so it's already familiar. Get different genome reference to choose from
and the gene sequence is easily available for Fasta and GenBank. Super easy to navigate and nice graphic which shows the translation direction of the gene.
Also easy accessible reference articles on the bottom.
Conclusion: Super clear and straightforward!
  
  
<li>ENSEMBL</li>
  <p>(http://www.ensembl.org/Human/Search/Results?q=;site=ensembl;facet_species=Human)<p>

> Direct link to UniProtKB which I've also used before in the summary. The summary on the top includes some info like
gene type, name and reference sequence. The graph is quite comprehensive with a nice legend. You can go to region detail if you
would like a more detailes graph and some additional information. However, I could find any Fasta/GenBank download option.
Conclusion: Informative graph but couldn't find sequence.
  
  
<li>COSMIC</li>
  <p>(https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic)<p>

> Mostly focused on found mutations across DNMT3A and their carcinogenic properties with a lot of information regarding mutation
frequency in a specific tissue. There's an incredibly cool tool to view the
3D structure of the molecule with mutation frequency indicated! I love this
Conclusion: I will use this site just for the 3D structure tool it's quite entertaining.
