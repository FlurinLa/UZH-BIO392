## Some thoughts on different resources

<ol>
<li>BUCSC Genome Browser</li>
  <p> (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) </p>
  
> Easy to find genes if you know their name. However on first glance it's a lot of information and quite detailed,
so it takes some time to find information on e.g. the genes location. 
Additionally I couldn't find a way to download the gene sequence (Fasta oe.) Nevermind I found it.
Conclusion: Looks complicated at first but ok to navigate after some time.
