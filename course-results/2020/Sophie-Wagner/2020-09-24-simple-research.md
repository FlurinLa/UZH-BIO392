## Genome resources

### [Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/)
* it's also possible to filter by organism
* You get a lot of biological information, which can be very useful, especially if you want to get familiar with a protein you don't know too much about.
* UniProtKB also gives some information and sources on different pathological occasions where the protein may be important and a list of variants related with the specific protein and disease (also linked to a source eg. ENSEMBl or ClinVar).
* And interaction table to show possible interactions with other proteins etc and a 3D structure.
* in general I think UniProtKB is great to first look up a certain protein and then go further from there.


### [Cosmic](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/browse/genome#)
* Their genome browser doesn't look as versatile with as many features as UCSC Genome Browser. 
* As far as I can tell you can only search in the human genome and only in GRCh37 & GRCh38.
* Honestly think it's kinda confusing
