* #### Sequencing by hybridization
> Uses arrayed, known (synthetic) DNA oligonucleatides on microchips. By repeatedly hybridizing and washing away the unwanted non-hybridized DNA one can
determine if the hybridising labeled fragments match the synthetic oligonucleatide.
Typically used to look for small changes in already know DNA fragments (eg. SNPs).
Some eg. are:

* #### Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS)

> In the second generation SBS was archieved by imaging/detecting the incorporated nucleotides. These technologies are mainly based
on reading many quite short (300 -500 bases) sequences in parallel and is error prone, especially if long streches of consecutive multiples of the same base occur.
In third and forth generation trend back to generate longer primary read lengths, while still keeping the massive parallel approach too. 

* [Ion Torrent](https://allseq.com/knowledge-bank/sequencing-platforms/ion-torrent/)
> (correct nucleotide incorporation releases a hydrogen, which can be measuren in the change of pH)
* [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology.html)

* #### Third generation sequencing
> In contrast to second generation sequencing methods, third generation sequencing methods aim to sequence long DNA (and RNA) molecules. 
SMRT method: It involves binding an engineered DNA polymerase, with bound DNA to be sequenced, to the bottom of a well. Because of the wells dimensions and
used wavelength, imaging only occurs on the bottom of the well where the nucleotide incorporation occurs. The nucleotides are labeled with for different fluorophores,
which can be detected during their release from the growing DNA strand.

* [Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)](https://www.pacb.com/)

* #### Forth generation sequencing
> The DNA strand gets threaded though a nanopore and nucleatide additions occurs in the nanopora and can be detected.
