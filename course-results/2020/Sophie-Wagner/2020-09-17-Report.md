## Task

#### Why do we use the terminal in bioinformatics?
It has many powerfull command-line tools, which make scripting quite easy. Therefore it increases reproducibility.

#### What is a plain text file?
A file which only contains text and no special formatting like bold/curved text etc. The file extension is usually .txt.

#### In bioinformatics, most of the data are stored in plain text files with added syntax/structure (and commonly compressed afterwards). For instance, fasta or fastq files we have discussed them today, but also SAM, BED, GTF, VCF and others (to be discussed next week). Why is that?
It doesn't need that much storage, therefore it allows to store greater amounts of information.

#### How can we list files, that are in a directory? Please provide the command(s).
* to see what's in the working directory: ls
* to see what's in a directory of your working directory: ls The_dir_u_wanna_see  (e.g.: ls course)

#### What | and > do in a terminal?
* | is the pipeline symbol to connect commands. The output of each element is the input of the next.
* > assigns the output to something. eg. curl -L link > File.txt means: Download this information from the link and put it in a file.

#### How do we print the last 10 lines of the file named /mnt/test/test.txt? Please provide the command(s).
* tail mnt/test/test.txt

#### How do we print the first column of the file named /mnt/test/test.txt whose columns are separatedby tabs? Please provide the command(s).


#### How can we print every third line of a text file? Please provide the command(s), and discuss what they do.


#### How can we transform FASTQ into FASTA files using standard Unix tools (sed, awk, etc)? Please provide the command(s), and discuss what they do.
