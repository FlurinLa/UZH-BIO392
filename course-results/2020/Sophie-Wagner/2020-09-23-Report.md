Which are the advantages of BED/coordinate files as compared to storing just sequences?

Which QC values are tracked during a bioinformatic variant calling NGS workflow? (from sequencing to variant calling)?

We’d like to store the following information. You can decide to encode them counting by 0, 1, and closed/open at your convenience (but please specify).

* Storing the sequences will result in big files. It uses less storage if we just save the positions of the gene on the reference genome.

Which QC (quality control) values are tracked during a bioinformatic variant calling NGS workflow? (from sequencing to variant calling)?
* Library preparation: sample QC of quality, quantity and integrity and correct amplification and purification before sequencing
* After sequencing and narrowing down regions of interest an alternate sequencing technology is used to verify the results.
* Base sequence quality scores, read depth, GC content information, sequence duplication levels and overrepresented sequences


We’d like to store the following information. You can decide to encode them counting by 0, 1, and closed/open at your convenience (but please specify).
* The “0-start, closed” system

We have three genomic intervals. All intervals are 1000 nt long. They are contiguous (head to tail). All in the plus strand. The first one starts
(we’d like to include the start nucleotide too) in position 1000 of chr2. We don’t have reads nor alignments, just scores (integers). 
Intervals A and B have a score of 0, and interval C has a score of 1000.

    Can we store this in SAM file? Why / why not?


    Can we store this in a BED3? How (please write down the BED file)? Are we losing any information?

    And in BED6? How? Are we losing any information?

    And in BED12? How? Are we losing any information?

    And in the most compact Wiggle as possible? How? Are we losing any information?

* No, we don't have the sequence

    Can we store this in a BED3? How (please write down the BED file)? Are we losing any information?
    BED3: chrom, start, end
    chr2    0999    1998
    chr2    1999    2998
    chr2    2999    3998

* yes we loose information: the score, interval category, strand info.

    And in BED6? How? Are we losing any information?
    BED6: chrom, start, end, name, score, strand
    chr2    0999    1998    A   0000    +
    chr2    1999    2998    B   0000    +
    chr2    2999    3998    C   1000    +

* We don't loose any information
    
    And in BED12? How? Are we losing any information?
    Possible, but unnecessary due to no information gain.

    And in the most compact Wiggle as possible? How? Are we losing any information?
    
    fixedStep chrom=chr2 start=999 step=1000 span=1000
    0
    0
    1000

* we loose information on the strand direction and interval category.
