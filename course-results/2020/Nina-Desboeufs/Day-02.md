## UCSC (University of California Santa Cruz) Genome browser 
I could find datasets specifically for **SARS-CoV-2** (i.e. lung expression). Really interesting was to find the **immunophetopying** related to COVID-19 using _t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding_ (t-SNE) algorithm. Give useful information about the frequency of each cell type. <http://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html>

### ClinVar 
I searched for **non-hodgkin lymphoma** variants. What I've found: 
* Location of the variation(s)
* Gene(s) involved as well as the protein changes 
* Clinical significance such as likely begign, pathogenic, uncertain significance and drug response

> Where I've found the information: [Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Variations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar?term=hodgkin%20lymphoma&cmd=correctspelling)

> One example of one of the variation: **NRAS** (NM_002524.5(NRAS):c.38G>T (p.Gly13Val)). It's a SNV, leading to a missense. Here is the publication for non-hodgkin lymphoma, [Chang M, 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26619011/).
