# Reference Genome Resources

## UCSC Genome browser [link](https://genome.ucsc.edu)
> _Short description_: UCSC ((University of California Santa Cruz), useful bioinformatics tool enabling the visualisation of the genome (of different species) at any scale, completed by a aligned annotations "tracks". The annotions consist for example of gene predictions, mRNA, SNPs.

> _Let's give it a try:_ I could find datasets specifically for **SARS-CoV-2** (i.e. lung expression). Really interesting was to find the **immunophetopying** related to COVID-19 using _t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding_ (t-SNE) algorithm. Give useful information about the frequency of each cell type. <http://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html>

## Human Genome Resources at NCBI [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/)
### ClinVar 
> _Short description:_ Link between genome variants and phenotype (namely disease) including the clinical relevance and supported by evidences (publications). 

> _Let's give it a try_: I searched for **non-hodgkin lymphoma** variants [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar?term=hodgkin%20lymphoma&cmd=correctspelling). What I've found: 
* Location of the variation(s)
* Gene(s) involved as well as the protein changes 
* Clinical significance such as likely begign, pathogenic, uncertain significance and drug response 

> One example of one of the variation: **NRAS** (NM_002524.5(NRAS):c.38G>T (p.Gly13Val)). It's a SNV, leading to a missense. Here is the publication for non-hodgkin lymphoma, [Chang M, 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26619011/). 


## Ensembl [link](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)
> _Short description:_ Contain vertebrate genomes, with gene identifications (annotation) and relationship to diseases. It offers varial bioinformatic tools such as BLAST/BLAT, Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), data slicer. 

> _Let's give it a try_: Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) allows the analysis of local alignment. Different BLAST are available:
