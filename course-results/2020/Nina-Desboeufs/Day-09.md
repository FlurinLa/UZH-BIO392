# Genomic Variation Types 
Literature 


**The landscape of somatic copy-number alteration across human cancers** (Beroukhim R. et al, 2010):
This study investigated the copy number profile in several cancer types and identifies features of chromosomal deletion and amplification, i.e. location. Main results: higher prevalence of arm-level somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) < focal SCNAs. But identification of > 300 relevant sites of focal SCNAs. < 1/4 of the identified regions are associated with known targets in cancers. 

> _Methods_: Affymetrix 250K Sty I array, CN profile by [GLAD](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/GLAD/inst/doc/GLAD.pdf), changes of .0.1 copies were considered as SCNA. 

> _Limitations_: They used a pool of cancer types, i.e. that some were slightly represented (few samples). The analysis was only focused on the genomic level (except for MYC, MCL1 and BCL2L1). Altough this allows a good comprehension of the pathway invovled in the variants, the expression data are relevant since epigenetic processes might interfer in the observed variants -> functional studies. 


**Copy number variations and cancer** (Adam Shlien and David Malkin, 2009), review:
Clinical impact of the CNVs. CNVS can alter the gene transcription (dosage, alteration of the regulatory regions). Three highlights: 
* Pathogenic CNVs often contain multiple gene.
* The effect of a pathogenic CNV is not limited to the gene(s) it contains.
* Pathogenic CNVs can have reciprocal deletions/duplications.
Cancer CNVs: 40% of the cancer-related genes are encountered or interrupter by a CNV. Single cancer CNV (as well as SNP) might lead to a minor increase in cancer risk (type-dependent) but combined together may definitely increase the risk. 200 cancer syndromes, mostly explained by mutations in the tumor suppressor genes, e.g. 

| Gene       | Cancer Syndrome |
:------------|:----------------
CDKN2A- p14ARF | Familial malignant melanoma 
CHEK2 | Familial breast cancer 
NF1 | Neurofibromatosis type 1
PTCH | Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome 

Beside CNVs predisposing to cancer, there are the acquired copy number alterations (CNAs) in tumors.
