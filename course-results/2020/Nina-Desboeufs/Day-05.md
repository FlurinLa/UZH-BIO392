# Genome Technologies 

## 1.General NGS technologies 

Sequencing techniques have been widely developped and through the next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, it is now possible to rapidly sequence the whole genome. The first generation sequencing technique is the **Sanger sequencing method** which uses a mix of dNTPs and fluorescent labelled ddNTPs. Although the available techniques use different detections methods, the principle stays the same for most of them. I.e. DNA or RNA is extracted from the sample and after denaturation, the genetic material is amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and finally detected. The detections methods include namely fluorescence, pH, electric current. Examples of NGS techniques: 

| Technique     | Detection     | Method        | Speed        | Error rate  | Generation | 
| :-------------|:--------------|:--------------|:-------------|:------------|:-----------|
| Illumina      | Fluorescence  | Bridge PCR, cluster formation | 1 - 10days | 0.1%. | 2nd |
| [Ion Torrent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBPKj0mMcDg)   | pH            | Emulsion PCR  | 2 - 7h       | 1%.         | 2nd |
| [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/applications/dna-nanopore-sequencing) | Electric current | Membrane with pores | 8 - 72h | 18%.  | 4th |
| [PacBio](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4678779/)| Fluorescence  | Nucleotides labelling, circular DNA, PCR | 0.5 - 4h | 13% | 3rd |
| [Pyrosequencing (Roche 454)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNKEhOGvcaI&feature=youtu.be) | Fluorescence | Emulsion PCR, pores, Luciferase | 24h | 0.1% | 2nd |
