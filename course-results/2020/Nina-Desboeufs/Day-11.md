# ClinVar and ClinGen

## 1. ClinVar [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)
ClinVar focuses on the variants and their link to clinical phenotype. See Day-02. 



## 2. ClinGen [link](https://clinicalgenome.org)
Clinical genome resource specially focuses on the gene and its possible variant(s) and associated phenotype(s). 

 Gene name | HGNC ID | chr location (hg38) | Gene product (protein function) |  disease | Calculated classification
:----------|:--------|:--------------------|:--------------------------------|:---------|:--------------------------
NOX1 | HGNC:7889 | chrX:100,843,324-100,874,359 | NADPH Oxidase 1 | not found | not found
APC | HGNC:583 | chr5:112,737,885-112,846,239 | APC | APC-related attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis  | Definitive 
TP53 | HGNC:11998 | chr17:7,668,402-7,687,538 | TP53 | Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1 | Definitive
CDKN2A | HGNC:1787 | chr9:21,967,753-21,975,098 | CDKN2A | melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome | Definitive 
KRAS | HGNC:6407 | chr12:25,205,246-25,250,929 | KRAS | Noonan Syndrome | 3C (high evidence)



As Nox1, a lot of genes, that I lokked for, were not curated (CD146, EGLN1/2/3, EPAS1, BCL2, OLFM3, ERBB2).
