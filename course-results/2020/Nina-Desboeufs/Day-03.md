# Terminal and Unix 

## FastQ Format 
It contains 4 lines per read sequence: 
* _line 1_: header line, identification of the sequence "@" 
* _line 2_: read sequence 
* _line 3_: comment line "+"
* _line 4_: Phred quality score (i.e. "a measure of the quality of the identification of the nucleobases generated by automated DNA sequencing")


**Useful command lines**: 
* To determine the number of sequence (number of line / 4): 
`wc file.fq | awk '{print $1 / 4}'`
* To retrieve each 1st/2nd/3rd/4th line of the read sequence (i.e. the sequence): 
`awk 'NR%4==1' file.sq` (NR: current line number; % modulo) (==2 / ==3/ ==0)
* Convert FastQ to Fast (and save): 
`awk 'NR % 4 == 1 {print ">"$1}; 
     NR % 4 == 2 {print}' SP1.fq \
     | > example.fa`
     
## Swiss-Prot flatfile 
Protein entries. Each line starts with a two character line code such as ID for the first, followed by "w\". The entry is ended by "\\".
