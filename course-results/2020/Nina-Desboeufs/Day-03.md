# Terminal and Unix 

## FastQ Format 
It contains 4 lines per read sequence: 
* _line 1_: identification of the sequence "@" 
* _line 2_: read sequence 
* _line 3_: comment line "+"
* _line 4_: Phred quality score (i.e. "a measure of the quality of the identification of the nucleobases generated by automated DNA sequencing")

**Useful command lines**: 
*To determine the number of sequence (number of line / 4): 
`wc file.fq | awk '{print $1 / 4}'`
* To retrieve each second line of the read sequence (i.e. the sequence): `awk 'NR%4==2' file.sq` (NR: current line number; % modulo)
