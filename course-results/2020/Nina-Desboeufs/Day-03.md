# Terminal and Unix 

## FastQ Format 
It contains 4 lines per read sequence: 
* _line 1_: header line, identification of the sequence "@" 
* _line 2_: read sequence 
* _line 3_: comment line "+"
* _line 4_: Phred quality score (i.e. "a measure of the quality of the identification of the nucleobases generated by automated DNA sequencing")


**Useful command lines**: 
* To determine the number of sequence (number of line / 4): 
`wc file.fq | awk '{print $1 / 4}'`
* To retrieve each 1st/2nd/3rd/4th line of the read sequence (i.e. the sequence): 
`awk 'NR%4==1' file.sq` (NR: current line number; % modulo) (==2 / ==3/ ==0)
* Convert FastQ to Fast (and save): 
`awk 'NR % 4 == 1 {print ">"$1}; 
     NR % 4 == 2 {print}' SP1.fq \
     | > example.fa`
     
## BED Format 
"BED (Browser Extensible Data) format provides a flexible way to define the data lines that are displayed in an annotation track". BED files consist at least of three fields: 
* **chrom**: the chromosome's name
* **chromStart**: the starting position 
* **chromEnd**: the ending position 
>and nine additional optional fields (name, score, strand, thickStart, thickEnd, itemRgb, blockCount, blockSizes, blockStarts)

     
## Swiss-Prot flatfile 
Protein entries. Each line starts with a two character line code such as ID for the first, followed by "w\". The entry is ended by "\\". 

## Unix shell 

  Command         | Function        
| --------------- |:----------------|
| history         |history of the commands used in the shell |
| clear           | clear the CLI   |
| kill            | terminate or signal a process |
|*                | matches any number of characters (none, one or more) in a file or directory name|
|? | matches exactly one character - use '??' to match any group of 2 characters|
| [] | specify a range of characters allowed at that position - use '!' to exclude a range of characters at that position |
| {} | specify a list of terms - separated by commas |
| ^ | All the lines that start with | 
| $ | All the lines that end with | 
| mv | move or rename a file or a directory | 
| cp _file, new name, location_ | Copy a file or a directory |
| tar | manipulate archives |
| chmod | Change file modes or access control lists | 
| find | walk a file hierarchy: _-name 'FileName'_ |
| cat | display file content |
| less | display the content of a text file one screen at a time (text viewer)|
| sort | sort or merge records (lines) of text and binary files (-u (unique), -n (numeric), -r (reverse))|
| \r | newline with MacOS, corresponding to '^M', UNIX '\n' |
| tr | translate characters, -d (delete), '' '' |
| diff | compares two files and retrieve the difference |
| grep | searches file(s) for words or patterns and displays the result lines | 
| uniq | report one line if several identical and adjacent lines are found | 


**Pipe "|"** allows us to pass from the output from one program **directly** to the input of another program.

## Questions 
* Why do we use the terminal in bioinformatics?
> Compared to the GUI, using the terminal allows to find the commands used (history).
---
* What is a plain text file?
> Every file that contains only text. 
---
* In bioinformatics, most of the data are stored in plain text files with added syntax/structure (and commonly compressed afterwards). For instance, fasta or fastq files we have discussed them today, but also SAM, BED, GTF, VCF and others (to be discussed next week). Why is that?
> File compression reduces the space for storage and speed up the data circulation

* How can we print every third line of a text file? Please provide the command(s), and discuss what they do.

* How can we transform FASTQ into FASTA files using standard Unix tools (sed, awk, etc)? Please provide the command(s), and discuss what they do.

Extract from the example.fa file, the 1st line (using the modulo 4 out of the number of current lines and print it with ">" (ID) for all lines ending up with 1. Similar for the 2nd line (seuqence), but just print it.
