Plink is a whole genome analysis data toolset allowing the analysis of genotype as well as phenotype data. It presents miscellaneous features such as data mangaement (e.g. files conversion, data extraction), 
statistics (e.g. frequency), population stratification (e.g. Complete linkage hierarchical clustering), etc. 

**Input file**:
* -vcf

* -file (.ped and .map)

**Convert file format**: 
* -make-bed (convert to .bed, .bim and .fam format) 
* -recode (convert to .ped and .map)
* -recode vcf (convert to vcf)
