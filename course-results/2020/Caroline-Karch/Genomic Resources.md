# Resources For Genomics

## General about Genome Browsers   

Genome browser are accessible for the publicity. It is a graphical interface for display of information from a biological database for genomic data. It enables researcher to get information about predicted structure, proteins, expression, regulation, variation, alternative splicing etc. 

Many genome browsers are accessible online. The best known and probably the most used browsers are: UCSC Genome Browser, Ensembl Genome Browser and NCBI’s Genome Data Viewer. 
I will make some short comments to those three genome browsers mentioned before.

### UCSC (University of California; Santa Cruz)
UCSC is an online Genome Browser. This browser allows to download genome sequences from several vertebrates and invertebrates. To be interpretable graphical tools for visualization are used. In this genome browser one can look at a specific species and further look for a specific gene of interest. We get information about the length of this gene and in which chromosome this gene is present. 
After looking for a specific gene, we can get insight about gene’s structure. The thicker lines characterize exons, which are needed for mature RNA (mRNA). The thinner lines, the introns, are spliced out to make a functional protein. The next line, in black, shows us the amino acids.

### Ensembl
Ensembl is a database that aims to provide a centralized resource of our own species and other vertebras and model organisms. Similar to UCSC Ensembl provides computer-generated visual displays of much of the data, for better understanding and interpretation. 

In Ensembl we can search for a species and a specific gene. We are able to see the localization of this gene and also neighboring-genes. By clicking at “transcript table” we see the different transcripts produced from this gene. To get graphical view one has to click at the protein of interest. Each gene and protein has a different number to be able to distinguish. There also are options to download the sequence in either FASTA or RTF. 
For me this genome browser seems to be better understandable since I can choose what figure I want to look at.

### NCBI Genome Data Viewer
NCBI is the national Center for Biotechnology Information, it’s a branch of National Institutes of Health (NIH). NCBI data viewer allows to view and analyze eukaryotic reference sequences (refseq). On the homepage the different species are presented in a phylogenetic tree. But it is also possible to look up for a specific species.

### Definition of Reference genome
A reference genome is a nucleic acid sequence database assembly. It is used as reference standards for well-characterized genes. Genomes that get sequenced are compared to those references to find mutations within the genomic sequence. Reference genomes are typically used as a guide on which new genomes are built, enabling them to be assembled much more quickly and cheaply than the initial Human Genome Project.

## Overall Impression
For me this Websites are completely new, and I know have learned how I can look for genes of interest and graphical pictures. But many of the pictures I do not understand (yet). It's good that these websites are accessible to everyone and therefore many researchers can profit at the same time. I hope that we will learn in this course how to “read”, interpret, and analyze those pictures.
