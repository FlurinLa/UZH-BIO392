# Task Day 10

## 1. We see a Câ†’T variant light up in red for the tumor but not the normal. What do you think is happening in 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam?

* It indicates that there is a SNP at that position. It is visible that only tumor cells have this variant, therefore this variant (this c -> exchange) might be specific for the loss of tp53.

## 2. What are the three grouped tracks for the bamout? What do the colors indicate? What differentiates the pastel versus gray reads?

* HC, normal and tumor
* The different colors refer to the different haplotypes
* The grey ones refer to no haplotype at all, because of that they are align with the reference
