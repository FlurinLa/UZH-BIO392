# List of genomic resources:

* 1000 Genomes: An interactive graphical viewer that allows users to explore variant calls, genotype calls and supporting evidence (such as aligned sequence reads) that have been produced by the 1000 Genomes Project.

* American Society of Human Genetics - Patient Information: Enhance genetics education by preparing future professionals and informing the public.

* Cancer Genetics Overview (PDQÂ®): Provides a number of resources for patients and consumers about cancer and genetics.

* CDC Public Health Genomics: The CDC Office of Public Health Genomics provides timely and credible information for the effective and responsible translation of genomics research into population health benefits.

* dbGaP: An archive and distribution center for the description and results of studies which investigate the interaction of genotype and phenotype. These studies include genome-wide association (GWAS), medical resequencing, 
molecular diagnostic assays, as well as association between genotype and non-clinical traits.

* Exome Variant Server: The goal of the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) is to discover novel genes and mechanisms contributing to heart, lung and blood disorders by pioneering the application of next-generation sequencing 
of the protein coding regions of the human genome across diverse, richly-phenotyped populations and to share these datasets and findings with the scientific community to extend and enrich the diagnosis, management and treatment of heart, lung and blood disorders.

* IGNITE: IGNITE is an NIH-funded network dedicated to supporting the implementation of genomics in healthcare.
