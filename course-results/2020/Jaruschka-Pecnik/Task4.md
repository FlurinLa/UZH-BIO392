# Task 4

for storing called variants:

file format | format | functions | information |
--- | --- | --- | --- |

SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) | { - Optional header section followed by an alignment section (https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf)
- Storing data: nucleotide sequences (generated by next generation sequencing technologies) and unmapped sequences} | same as BAM, but more readable for humans |
                               
VCF (Variant Call Format) | 

FASTA | 


for full archival purposes:

- BAM (Binary Alignment/Map)



for browser visualization:

-	BED (Browser Extensible Data)
