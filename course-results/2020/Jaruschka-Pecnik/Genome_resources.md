# notes concerning exploring the genome resources



IGSR | informative, the overview is not very appealing 
NIH | looks very informative (paragraphs about genomics, genetic disorders...)
CGI | portal that interprets sequences according to validated oncogenic alterations and makes prediction | 
CIViC | database of clinical variants and its interpretation in cancer
MolecularMatch | an app, can't get in it without signing in (only for information about COVID-19)
PharmGKB | everything about pharmacology (drugs, pathways...) and and publication search portal
