# Questions to GATK


1. We see a Câ†’T variant light up in red for the tumor but not the normal. What do you think is happening in 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam?
On the locus 7'674'220 the base in the reference genome shows a C. In the 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam BAM file are the tumor and normal variants combined, where all the transitions of 60% from C to T come form the tumor.bam file (red ones). Further in this 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam are bases that exhibit the same base as the reference genome marked in blue and make up to 40%.


2. What are the three grouped tracks for the bamout? What do the colors indicate? What differentiates the pastel versus gray reads?
