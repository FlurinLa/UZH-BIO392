# Reading up on Genome Technologies
* [General NGS technologies](https://github.com/compbiozurich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-material/2020/2018-04-01___Slatko-et-al.__Next-Generation-Sequencing-Technologies__Curr-Prot-Mol-Biol__review.pdf)
    * First generation sequencing:
     Sanger method: uses fluoresent/radioactive ddNTPs to induce a chain determination during in vitro DNA replication.
    * Second Generation sequencing:
      - Sequencing by hybridization
        Arrayed DNA oligonucleotides of known sequence on filters get hybridize to labeled fragments of the DNA to be sequented. By repeatedly hybridizing and washing away the unwanted non-hybridized DNA, we see which labeled DNA fragments matches the DNA on the filter.
      - Sequencing by synthesis (SBS)
        SBS methods use a solid support containing muicro channels/wells in which the sequencing reactions occur. Reversible terminators are used for a normal, continous nucleotide incorporation. 
* count based vs. intensity based as principle

* BONUS: dig deeper for some molecular-cytogenetic techniques: 
  * [SNP, aCGH arrays](https://github.com/compbiozurich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-material/2020/2011-07-18___Schaaf%2C-Wiesnieszka-and-Beaudet__Copy-Number-and-SNP-Arrays-in-Clinical-Diagnostics__Ann-Rev-Genom__review.pdf)

------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------
Single sequence oligonucleotides of ~ 60bp | Two 20-60bp oligonucleotides of different sequence
Two labeled DNAs (patient and control) per hybridization | Only patient DNA labeled and hybridizied
Resolution down to size of oligonucleotides; exon by exon | Resolution limited by SNP distribution and signal to background
No detection of **U**ni**P**arental **D**isony or consanguinity | Able to detect consanguinity and most UPD
Limited SNP addition possible recently | Detection of most known clinically relevant **C**opy **N**number **V**ariants but not exon by exon
