*  We see a C→T variant light up in red for the tumor but not the normal. What do you think is happening in 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam?  
> 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam shows the comparison of the tumor and normal sample. The coloured (red) T indicates that the tumor has a Tyrosin instead of a Cystin (compared to the reference and the normal sample).
*  What are the three grouped tracks for the bamout? What do the colors indicate? What diﬀerentiates the pastel versus gray reads?
