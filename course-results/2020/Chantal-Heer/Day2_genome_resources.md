> Genome resources
> ================
>
> There are many different resources to find genomics. You can can find pages with *normal* (reference) genomics or some specific for variations.
>
> ## Resources for (reference) genomics
> *The following websites show you the reference genome of a species. However, some also provide information about genome variations.*
> 1. USCS Genome Browser
>>  [This website](http://genome.ucsc.edu/) is made by the University of California Santa Cruz based on the international Human Genome Project in 2000. However, now covers this broswer also genomes of many vertebrates and model organisms species. The various tools can help you by browsing through a genome. You can even download genomes e.g. from an alpca. Most of the time you have the choise between several genomes (e.g. different alpacas or different date of categorisation).
> 2. Human genome resources at NCBI
>>   [This page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/human/) shows you the human chromosomes. You can look at a specific chromosme or search for a gene. The website provides you the two recennt human reference genomes. You can download various information from a genome when you don't want to download the whole one. When you scroll down you can find more resources, also some for variations (covered down below). You also find some fact sheets for the additional resources. These are helpful to find the resource you need.
> 3. Ensembl
>>   [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) is a genome browser for vertrbrates (and some chordates and eucaryotes). You can search a specific gene(region), protein in all species or in a particular genome. Various tools help you on this genome browser. Clicking on a genome (e.g. Orangutan) shows what you can find on this website about the genome (even variations). Every category has an information what it contains. Some informations can be downloaded.

> ## Resources for genome variant data
> *The following resources are specially to find divergence (mutation, variation, cancer ...) from the reference genome.* 
> 1. NCBI
>
> The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has several databases, for example:
> * NCBI:dbSNP
>>  [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) provides singel nucleotide variations, microsatellites, small-scale insertions and deletions of the human genome. You can find common variants but also clinical mutations. The website provides examples of search terms for a better, faster searching.
> * NCBI:dbVAR
>>   For larger variants (more than 50bp) of the human genome, you better use [dbVAR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar). This website covers variations such as insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, mobile elements, translocations and complexer variants (such as complex chromosomal rearrangements).
> * NCBI:ClinVar
>>    [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) is an archieve of reports about the relationship between human genome variation, their phenotype and observed health outcome. 
> 2. EMBL-EBI:EVA
>>   The European Variation Archive of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute (short [EMBL-EBI:EVA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/)) provides an open-access database of all genetic variation types of many species. You can select a species and search for a SNP. For a more specified search, EMBL-EBI provides a Variant Browser. 
> 3. COSMIC
>>   [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) is a resource for somatic mutations in human cancer. You can browse the data by tissue type, histology, gene, mutation, cancer type ...
> 4. ClinGen
>>   The Nationnal Institues of Health (NIH) provides [this resource](https://clinicalgenome.org/). It shows how genes and their variations impact body, lead to diseases and the use in precisin medicine and research. You can search for a specific gene, disease or variant. ClinGen provides help when you are new to the website.
> 5. arrayMap
>>    [This resource](https://arraymap.progenetix.org/) contains the copy number profiles of various human cancers. Many search criteria specify and simplfy the search.
