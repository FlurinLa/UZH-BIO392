# Genomic Resource Web Browsers

## Ensembl: 
* Website URL: ensembl.org

**Introduction**
* Ensembl Genomic Browser was launched in 1999 by European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) which owns European Variant Archive database stroing variation from \
numerous species. 

**Features**

* Stores genome reference assemblies for a lot of species with the constant updates (e.g. sheep reference genome and pig reference genome of 12 novel breeds)
* Stores main information about genes: chromosome coordinates, splicing isoforms, regulatory elements for a lot of species.
* Genetic variation linked with the genes of interest: SNPs, short indels, somatic SNVs and structural variations.
* Comparative genomics features of the gene of interest: gene tree, orthologues, paralogues and genomic alignments with other species.
* Highlighted pathways where genes of interest are annotated
* Stores reference genome annotation files in gtf, gff3 and bed formats

**Tools**

* Genomic Alignment tools: BLASTN, TBLASTX, BLAT. BLAST is aminoacid and nucleotide alignment algorithm developed at NCBI using less time-consuming but relatively inaccurate method \
than Smith-Waterman algorithm. BLASTN is a subtype of BLAST which takes and outputs nucleotide sequences. TBLASTX takes nucleotide as query, translates it in \
six-frames and aligns to six frames of nucleotide database sequence. BLAT is an pairwise sequence alignment software developed at UCSC. 

[BLAST algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAST_(biotechnology)#:~:text=In%20bioinformatics%2C%20BLAST%20(basic%20local,DNA%20and%2For%20RNA%20sequences)
[BLAT algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAT_(bioinformatics))

* Variant Effect Predictor: takes VCF, HGVS variant calling format files and based on transcript annotation files (e.g. RefSeq transcripts, ENSEMBL/GENCODE \
transcripts), identifies the effect of the variant on transcript function. 

* Linkage Disequilibrium Calculator
* Assembly Converter

## ClinGen:
* Website URL: https://clinicalgenome.org/

**Introduction**
* ClinGen is NIH-funded portal storing the clinical implications of the genes and the associated variants for contribution to personalized medicine. 

**Features**

* Standardized curation procedure documents of gene-disease connection (i.e. strength of evidence), variant pathogenicity, clinical actionability (genes conferring severe \
risk of disease), dosage sensitivity (evidence upholding haploinsufficiency or triplosensitivity of genes in the disease) and somatic variants (i.e. evidence \
supporting effect of somatic variants in tumor).
* Stores information on genes and variants about the above described concepts. 

**Tools**

* Tools to explore issues on Gene-Disease Validity, Variant Pathogenicity, Clinical Actionability, Dosage Sensitivity and Somatic Variants combining genetic, \
population, clinical, functional evidence with a class of 1-5 experts in the connected fields evaluating variant.
* ClinVar Miner: investigates variants in ClinVar portal by their significance, by gene and by condition.
*Patient Data Sharing Program: process of sharing data of patients through GenomeConnect and other tools. 

## COSMIC:
* Website URL: https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic

**Introduction**
* COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) was developed in 2004 by Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and holds somatic mutations and their impact in human \
cancer.

**Features**

* Stores list of genes (Cancer Gene Census) with reported somatic variations in human cancer.
* Stores list of gene fusions reported in solid tumors and leukemias.
* Stores name of the genes and associated mutations, conferring acquired (after treament) and intrinsic (before treatment) drug resistance in human cancer therapies.
* Exhibits mutational signatures from the pubmed literature with mutational profiles across tissues, their etiologies and connection with other mutational \
signatures. 
-Note: currently there are three types of mutational signatures [single base substitution](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/SBS/index.tt), 
[doubtlet base substituion](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/DBS/index.tt), [small insertion and deletion](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/ID/index.tt)


**Tools**

* Cancer Browser: find somatic mutations based on tissue type and histology
* Genome Browser: find information about gene coordinates, splicing isoforms and somatic mutations
* CONAN (Copy number analysis):  find info about amplification, homozygous deletion and loss of heterozygosity of the gene or genomic coordinate.
* GA4GH Beacon Query: take the variant as input and output if mutant allele for it exists.
