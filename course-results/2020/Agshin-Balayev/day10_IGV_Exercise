Question: We see a Câ†’T variant light up in red for the tumor but not the normal. What do you think is happening in 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam?
Answer: Since 2_tumor_normal_m2.bam is a reassembly file, it contains reads supporting variant T from the tumor in red and reference C from the normal bam file in \
in blue. It indicates that there are three haplotypes for the region. 

Question: What are the three grouped tracks for the bamout? What do the colors indicate? What differentiates the pastel versus gray reads?
Answer: Three grouped tracks: tumor bam, normal bam and our sample (i.e. chr17). Colors are indicative of different haplotypes where gray reads are \
the ones assigned to reference haplotype. Pastel colors show reads assigned to various haplotypes.
