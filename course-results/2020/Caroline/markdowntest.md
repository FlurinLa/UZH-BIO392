# NCBI's Reference Sequence ( RefSeq ) project
## Definition of Reference genome
A reference genome is a nucleic acid sequence database assembly. It is used as reference standards for well-characterized genes. Genomes that get sequenced are compared to those references to find mutations within the genomic sequence. Reference genomes are typically used as a guide on which new genomes are built, enabling them to be assembled much more quickly and cheaply than the initial Human Genome Project.


# Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen)
## Key goals of ClinGen
- make avaiable genomic and phenotypic data between clinicians and researchers through centralized and federated databases 
- develop and implement standards to support clinical annotation in interpretation of genes and variants
- develop standards, facilitate integration into healthcare delivery
