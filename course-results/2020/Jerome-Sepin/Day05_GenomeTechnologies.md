# Genome Technologies:

## General NGS technologies:

### Sanger sequencing (1977): 
Pros:
remains the most appropriate
not too expensive anymore (due to relatively cheap primers and automation)

Cons:
relatively slow
no high troughput

### Second Generation
Because of the need for analysis of large genomes at low costs.

#### Sequencing by hybridization (1980):
Pros:
* possible to build larger related sequence information, based upon overlapping information from the probe hybridization
spots
* Identification of disease-realted SNPS in specific genes
* Idetification of gross chromosome abnormalities

Cons:
* depend on using specific probes to analyse sequences

#### Sequencing by synthesis:



## count based vs. intensity based as principle
