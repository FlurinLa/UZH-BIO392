# Genome Technologies:

## General NGS technologies:

### First Generation - Sanger sequencing (1977): 
---
Pros:
remains the most appropriate
not too expensive anymore (due to relatively cheap primers and automation)

Cons:
* relatively slow
* no high troughput

### Second Generation
---
Because of the need for analysis of large genomes at low costs.

#### Sequencing by hybridization (1980):
Pros:
* possible to build larger related sequence information, based upon overlapping information from the probe hybridization
spots
* Identification of disease-realted SNPS in specific genes
* Idetification of gross chromosome abnormalities

Cons:
* depend on using specific probes to analyse sequences

#### Sequencing by synthesis:

##### Pyrosequencing:
Pros:
* (first "second" generation sequencing method)
* "long" read lenght (600 - 800 bp)
* reletively high troughput (25 million bases, at 99% or better accuracy in a 4 hr run)

Cons:
* discontinued in 2013

##### Ion Torrent (2011?):
Pros:
* no need for camera or detector because only the voltage needs to be measured -> increase in speed
* (comes with a large number of application)

Cons:
* Large homopolymer sequences are difficult to discover

##### Illumina Technology:
Pros:
* major player
* can support millions of parallel cluster reactions
* fast due to the use of fluorescent detection
* sequence errors can be detected due to the large amount of data generated

Cons:
* lack of synchrony in the synthesis can arise

### Third Generation
---
Because of the need for analysis of long DNA molecues (and RNA)

#### Pacific Bioscience (PacBio):
Pros:
* current commercialized leader 
* Single Molecule Real time (SMRT) sequencing
* very long fragments (30 - 50 kb)
* millions of molecules simultaneously
* can detect modifications (methylation)

Cons:
* need to have a circular dsDNA
* not all modifications can be identified (Epigenetic)
* suffers from a inherently high error rate

### "Fourth" Generation
---
Long DNA molecules get passed trough small "holes" and one measures the differnt currents caused by the nucleotides passing by.

#### Oxford Nanopore Technologie (2015):
Pros:
* long DNA molecules
* small size -> portable
* large number of molecules can be sequenced (reduces error)
* can identify base modification
* low-cost

Cons:
* relativels high error rate


## count based vs. intensity based as principle
