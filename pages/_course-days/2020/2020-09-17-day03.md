### File formats

#### Slides

* [File formats slides](https://github.com/compbiozurich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-material/2019/imallona/2_genomics.pdf)

#### Exercises

These exercises provide a flow of learning by doing. Still, some of them need to be delivered as a report (Due date Sept 26 5pm)

* [Exercises (morning)](https://github.com/compbiozurich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-material/2020/imallona/3_exercises.md)
 - Exercises 5-14 cover FASTA and FASTQ.

You can launch a terminal in MacOS and GNU/Linux. If running another OS, plese make use a [a Web-browser based emulator](https://cocalc.com/app?anonymous=terminal) or a Linux virtual machine.

#### Cheatsheets:

* [Shell](https://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf)
* [awk](https://gist.github.com/Rafe/3102414)

For extra/advanced reading, please check the following tutorials on bash and awk:

* [Shell](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sh.html)
* [awk](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html)

### Report

Please commit to the BIO392 github a markdown report (due date Sept 26 5pm) describing:

- Why do we use the terminal in bioinformatics?

- What is a plain text file?

- In bioinformatics, most of the data are stored in plain text files with added syntax/structure (and commonly compressed afterwards). For instance, fasta or fastq files we have discussed them today, but also SAM, BED, GTF, VCF and others (to be discussed next week). Why is that?

- How can we list files are in a directory? Please provide the command(s).

- What `|` and  `>` do in a terminal?

- How do we print the last 10 lines of the file named `/mnt/test/test.txt`? Please provide the command(s).

- How do we print the first column of the file named `/mnt/test/test.txt` whose columns are separatedby tabs? Please provide the command(s).

- How can we print every third line of a text file? Please provide the command(s), and discuss what they do.

- How can we transform FASTQ into FASTA files using standard Unix tools (sed, awk, etc)? Please provide the command(s), and discuss what they do.
